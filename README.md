## ChangeLog and updates

- There is a [`dev` branch](https://github.com/yinan-c/RSS-GPT/tree/dev) for manual updates on the script, auto commits will no longer be pushed to this `dev` branch. The purpose of doing this is to separate the manual updates and auto commits, so that it is easier to check the updates and pull to your repo.
- Check out the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
