<p>I’m excited to offer the next giveaway, a 1-year subscription ($108 value) for <a href="https://timingapp.com/">Timing</a>. I use Timing daily and it’s helped me automatically track time that I would never have had the discipline to manage on my own. Billable hours, time I spend on personal projects, time I spend gaming, pretty much anything I do on my Mac, my iPhone, or my iPad gets tracked and I can easily categorize based on rules (that are as easy as dragging and dropping to generate). I even integrated it with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/">Doing</a> for adding depth to my “What Was I Doing” tracking.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just keep focusing on your work while Timing records your time automatically, then review your time when you want to. Record time faster than ever with just a few clicks. See when you worked on what and how productive you were.</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Historical weather for Journal CLI</title>

<p>I pushed a couple updates to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a>, my command line journaling tool today.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you can add a natural language argument to your journal command which will set the date of the entry, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journal mood "yesterday 8pm"</code>. This allows you to create entries in post with historical data you might have missed. One thing that it didn’t do well, though, is to get the <em>correct</em> weather for any weather type questions in the journal when using past dates. This latest update is able to get historical weather data and insert it correctly in the entry. No changes required for the user, just enter a past date and Journal will figure it out.</p>

<p>Second, I’ve noticed my mood and sleep shifts with the moon phase. I’m not into astrology or anything, but that seemed like useful data to track and start to draw better conclusions from. So now a question type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.forecast</code> will include the moon phase as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moon_phase</code> key, and you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.moon</code> to get just the moon phase for its own entry. The forecast in Markdown will also now include the moon phase.</p>

<p>That’s it, just tying up some loose ends. Journal is working pretty well for me to collect data and provide my therapist with detailed mood/behavior information. Let me know if there’s anything it doesn’t do that might help you out!</p>

<p>The latest version can be installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. Visit the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> project page for more info.</p>

<title>Automatically sort emails to custom folders with Sanebox [Sponsor]</title>

<p>Thanks to Sanebox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I just trained 3 new senders into custom Sanebox folders today (just by moving an email from them once) and will never have to see them in my Inbox again, and will be able to easily locate them when I <em>do</em> want to see them. It’s so easy!</p>

            </a></p>

<p>SaneBox is once again under the spotlight for their cutting-edge solutions to the age-old problem of email clutter. Having earned the endorsement of seasoned professionals, it’s worth diving deeper into another feature that makes SaneBox the power tool for email management. One feature that is particularly enchanting? Custom Folders.</p>

<p>Imagine this: You receive countless emails daily from various sources. Newsletters from your favorite brands, updates from work, personal emails, bulk offers, and then, those pesky spam mails. Now, think of an assistant who not only sorts your emails but also does it exactly how you would. That means keeping in mind your unique preferences and priorities. That’s what SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature offers.</p>

<p>At the core of SaneBox is its learning ability. For example, as you shuffle emails in and out of folders like @SaneLater or @SaneBlackHole, SaneBox observes. Over time, it finds patterns in your preferences and ensures similar emails find their rightful place automatically in the future. It’s like training your dog to fetch. Once it learns which toy is its favorite, it fetches it every single time.</p>

<p>One particularly intriguing aspect of this feature is the flexibility it offers. Let’s say you’re working on a project, and you want all communications about it to be in one place. Simply create a Custom Folder named “@ProjectX.” As you get emails related to the project, drag a few to the new folder, and then SaneBox will quickly learn to play fetch.</p>

<p>The beauty of SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature lies in its adaptability. It’s not just about categorizing. It’s about creating an email ecosystem that aligns with your work habits and priorities. The more seamless a process is, the more likely you’ll be to use it. So that adaptability is critical.</p>

<p>In essence, SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature is more than just about organization. It’s about crafting a personalized email experience. It’s a testament to how adaptive technology can be when it’s designed with the user at its core.</p>

<p>If you’re still juggling with emails and feeling the stress of a cluttered inbox, perhaps it’s time to give SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature a try. And remember, <a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">signing up today can even get you a $25 discount on any subscription</a>. Make your email work for you, not the other way around!</p>

<title>Journal updates with weather types and conditional questions</title>

<p>In case you missed it, I recently released <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal CLI">Journal</a>, a CLI for keeping a journal with structured data that can be queried and analyzed. An update is live with a couple of nifty new features.</p>

<p>First, instead of just a type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather</code> for a question (which inserts the current condition and daily forecast), you can now specify sub-types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.current</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.forecast</code>. This outputs separate data entries to the JSON, and creates individual answers in the Markdown/Day One versions. You can still just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather</code> as the type to insert all data.</p>

<p>Second, you can now apply conditions to questions to determine whether they’ll be asked or not when creating an entry. Right now only time-based conditions are implemented, but I plan to add some functionality around basing a question’s appearance on the answer to a previous question, like “if health rating is less than 5, display the health notes question.” But for now you can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition: before noon</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition: &gt; 2pm</code> to any question or section to only display the question(s) at certain times of day.</p>

<p>I needed these conditions because I like to create a mood entry in the morning with data about sleep and coffee, and in the evening I don’t want to repeat that data, but do want to ask some different questions about how the day went. I could create two separate journals for these, but this way I can compile all of my data in one file. Questions that are skipped get a null entry in the JSON, so when I’m parsing I just test for nil and skip entries that don’t contain the information I’m trying to output. Unanswered questions don’t get added to the Markdown/Day One entries at all.</p>

<p>This release includes a couple of bug fixes as well. I recently removed the requirement for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gum</code> CLI, if it doesn’t exist it will now just use Readline for input. When using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gum</code> inputs, you can’t CTRL-c to cancel an entry, which I’m trying to figure out a way around right now.</p>

<p>Update using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. Visit the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal CLI">project page</a> for more info and installation instructions.</p>

<div> Jekyll plugin, countdown, 40% off sale, coupon, September 16th,
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一个Jekyll插件，可以用来实现倒计时功能。作者通过插件创建了一个倒计时，用于促销活动。文章中提到了一个40%折扣销售，截止日期是9月16日，使用特定的优惠码可以享受折扣优惠。 <div>
<p>So, a long time ago I wrote this Jekyll plugin that does countdowns and I don’t think I ever really used it. You just give it an end date and it inserts a countdown into the post. But I needed something to count down to, so I’m running a 40% off <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> sale using the coupon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COOLPLUGINBRO</code> until Saturday, September 16th. Here’s your countdown:</p>

<div class="btcountdownwrapper">
            <p class="btcountdowncaption">Sale ends in...</p>
            <div class="btcountdown"><time datetime="2023-09-16T23:59:00-05:00"></time></div>
            </div>

<p>Did it work? I hope so. Use <a href="http://pay.paddle.com/checkout/489454?coupon=COOLPLUGINBRO">this link to apply the coupon directly</a>, or enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COOLPLUGINBRO</code> at checkout. Learn more about Marked at <a href="https://marked2app.com">marked2app.com</a>.</p>

<title>Journal and integrations</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16342944/journal-and-integrations</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16342944/journal-and-integrations</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 日期类型、字典类型、集成应用、JSON格式、功能扩展 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了对Journal软件的功能改进，包括日期类型和字典类型的定义，以及与Obsidian等应用的集成。通过引入YAML数据，可以更好地控制结构化数据，便于构建分析工具。此外，文章还提到了版本更新和软件安装方法。 <div>
<p>I’ve made some changes to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> (I didn’t mess with the data format this time) that add some functionality and will maybe help with integrating with some apps like Obisidian.</p>

<p>First, you can now define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> type. Date entries will be parsed from natural language into date objects, so on the command line you can enter something like “yesterday 5pm” or “july 20 12pm” and get a proper date object added to your JSON and Markdown entries. Great for things like logging book review dates, workout days, etc.</p>

<p>You can also now define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dictionary</code> type for a question, which along with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key</code> definition creates a nested data set with any dot notation keys that match. So you can define the following:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">mood</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">sections</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Status"</span>
    <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">status</span>
    <span class="na">questions</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health</span>
        <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">dictionary</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health.rating</span>
        <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">numeric</span>
        <span class="na">prompt</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Health Rating</span>
        <span class="na">min</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>
        <span class="na">max</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">10</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health.notes</span>
  <span class="na">    type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">multiline</span>
        <span class="s">prompt</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s">Health Notes</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The data that gets output will include this format in the JSON:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"mood"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"rating"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"notes"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Just some notes on my health"</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows for more control over the structured data. It won’t be a big deal for most people as answers were already nested within section keys and could be grouped using dot syntax, this just allows the structure to go one level deeper which may help with building analytics tools.</p>

<p>The big change that will allow more integrations with apps like Obsidian is that all numeric and date answers are now included as YAML front matter in any individual Markdown files created. This will allow integration with existing tools like <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">Obsidian Dataview</a>, which allows you to create data views based on YAML data in your Obsidian notes. By pointing Journal to your Vault folder, you can have journal entries added to your vault and queryable with Dataview. I haven’t tested this, I just noted that it should be possible with the addition of the YAML data. For the time being I’m not including any string responses in the YAML, as that seems redundant since they’re also included in the body text and available to search.</p>

<p>This update won’t affect data saved to single Markdown files or added to Day One. If you have any ideas about how this could be made more useful, please let me know! Either via the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/journal-cli/discussions">Discussions</a> or by <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">contacting me directly</a>.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.19 is out now, just install or upgrade with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">project page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>More na updates</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16340947/more-na-updates</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16340947/more-na-updates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Command line tool, na, theming, new commands, changelog, TaskPaper files.
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了命令行工具na的最新版本更新，包括了主题设置、新的命令和修复的问题等内容。na是一个用于读取和修改TaskPaper文件的工具。更新后的na版本增加了主题设置功能，使得用户可以自定义操作的颜色输出。此外，还添加了一些新的命令和改进，以及修复了一些问题。详细的更新内容可以在文章的changelog中查看。 <div>
<p>I’ve put some more time into both <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code>. The latest version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> represents quite a few hours of tinkering. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">na project page</a> for full details. In case you’ve missed in previously, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> is my command line tool for reading and modifying TaskPaper files in your projects.</p>

<p>I think the biggest thing I’ve added is theming. You can now control the colorized output of your actions using a file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/na/theme.yaml</code>. That file is automatically written by na if it runs and it doesn’t exist, and once it’s there, it should be pretty self explanatory. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{y}</code> type placeholders (that would make the following text yellow, a full list of color abbreviations is at the top of the file), and you can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#RGB}</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#RRGGBB}</code> codes to get specific colors outside of the usual ANSI coloring.</p>

<p>I’ve added new commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag</code> (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na help tag</code>), and a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--restore</code> option to several commands for removing the @done tag from actions. There’s also a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--replace</code> flag you can tie into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --search SEARCH_STRING --replace REPLACE_STRING</code> to perform (wildcard-compatible) search and replace. Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--regex</code> to do a regex search and replace.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of other new stuff, so I’ll just post the collected changelog.</p>

<h4 id="new">NEW</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Global option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--include_ext</code> can be configured to use full extension when displaying filenames, allowing for command-clicking to open in compatible terminals</li>
  <li>Tag command</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--save NAME</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code> to save more complex queries and run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved NAME</code> (or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na NAME</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved --select</code> flag to allow interactive selection of search(es)</li>
  <li>Open the todos database in an editor with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na todos --edit</code></li>
  <li>A theme file is written to ~/.local/share/na/theme.yaml where you can modify the colors used for all displays</li>
  <li>Allow TAG=~PATTERN comparison for regex matching in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na tagged</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na undo</code> command to undo last change or last change to file specified in arguments</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --search OLD_TEXT --replace NEW_TEXT</code> (added –replace)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="improved">IMPROVED</h4>

<ul>
  <li>When displaying actions wider than the screen, wrap at words and indent 2 spaces from start of action (after prefix)</li>
  <li>When not showing notes, add an asterisk at the end of an action</li>
  <li>When showing notes, indent to the beginning of the action</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--project</code> to archive, complete, and update to move a modified action to a new project when saving</li>
  <li>Allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved --delete</code> to handle multiple arguments</li>
  <li>Allow wildcards when deleting saved searches</li>
  <li>Refactor request for input, no change to user experience</li>
  <li>Refined wildcard (?*) handling</li>
  <li>Better error message for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code> when no todo is matched</li>
  <li>If STDOUT isn’t a TTY, don’t enable pagination, regardless of global setting</li>
  <li>Disable pagination when using –omnifocus</li>
  <li>Allow –find or –grep as synonyms for –search</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--in TODO</code> option for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na complete</code></li>
  <li>If a search string contains @tags and –exact or –regex isn’t specified, the @tags will be extracted and passed as a –tagged search.</li>
  <li>Tag handling (including values and comparisons) in tags extracted from search strings</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na complete --project PROJ</code> flag to move to a specific project</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na restore --project PROJ</code> flag to move restored action to</li>
  <li>Exit gracefully if tagged command is run with invalid arguments</li>
  <li>Display action affected when using update command</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">FIXED</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Change default :dirname coloring to fix an occasional highlighting issue</li>
  <li>Error when creating new project in todo file</li>
  <li>Error when last_modified.txt hasn’t been written yet</li>

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--no-color</code> wasn’t stripping templated hex codes</li>
  <li>Escape search for tokens to allow parenthesis and other reserved characters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Time is your most precious resource.</strong> You <em>need</em> to know how you are spending it.</p>

<p><strong>But time tracking is no fun.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://timingapp.com/brett2023" rel="nofollow">Timing</a> fixes that.</strong><br />
It <em>automatically</em> tracks <em>all</em> your time, without you lifting a finger:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timing records how long you use each app, document, and website — without start/stop timers. <strong>These timmes can also be automatically categorized using rules, so you don’t have to do it manually.</strong></li>
  <li>It <strong>imports your iPhone and iPad usage</strong> from Screen Time, giving you a complete picture of all your device usage. No other time tracking app for Mac does this!</li>
  <li>In addition, Timing will also import <strong>phone calls from your iPhone</strong>, so those don’t get lost.</li>
  <li>The same goes for meetings you attend: Timing will automatically <strong>show events from your calendar</strong>, so you never forget to record time spent in meetings again.</li>
  <li>But even when a meeting isn’t on your calendar, Timing automatically <strong>recognizes when a call ends</strong> and lets you record time for it, so that no meeting goes untracked.</li>
  <li>Similarly, when you return to your Mac after a break, Timing will <strong>ask you what you did</strong> during your time away.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these features are <em>optional</em> and configurable, of course. And its <strong>brand-new vertical timeline</strong> makes it even easier to see what you did at a glance.</p>

<p>Timing is the one time-tracking app that will <em>really</em> give you <strong>a complete picture of where your time goes,</strong> all while <em>taking</em> you <strong>much less time to maintain</strong> than other time trackers.</p>

<title>Important Journal CLI updates</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16338322/important-journal-cli-updates</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16338322/important-journal-cli-updates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> dot syntax, nested keys, data format, custom folders, tool usefulness<br /><br />总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了一个工具的更新内容，修复了使用点语法嵌套键时出现的问题，并添加了自定义文件夹选项来保存条目。这些改进使得工具更加实用。 <div>
<p>Just a couple quick updates to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">Journal CLI</a> I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/09/06/journal-a-cli-for-journaling/">published yesterday</a> that I wanted everyone who was trying it out to know about before they have too much data in it.</p>

<p>First, if keys were nested using dot syntax, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">health.rating</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">health.sleep</code>, it would create a hash like:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"rating"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> 
      </span><span class="nl">"sleep"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="w"> 
   </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">  
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the “health” key got doubled and nested inside of the section key. This isn’t the way it was supposed to work with the dot syntax. Version 1.0.15 fixes this, if a key is repeated it’s merged with the parent key instead of nesting.</p>

<p>I also added options for defining custom folders to save entries in. At the top level you can include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entries_folder</code> with a path to any folder on your system. Journals will all save to that folder with subdirectories for each of their keys. You can instead define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entries_folder</code> within a journal definition, allowing each journal to have a custom location. JSON and Markdown will be written to these folders based on settings.</p>

<p>That should help make this tool a bit more useful, sorry for changing the data format, but better sooner than later. Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">project page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>Journal, a CLI for journaling</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16334303/journal-a-cli-for-journaling</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16334303/journal-a-cli-for-journaling</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> couple's therapy, neurodivergence, command-line tool, data collection, journaling<br /><br />总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了一种命令行工具，用于在夫妻治疗中收集数据并进行日记记录。这个工具可以处理数字、字符串和多行输入，并且可以创建Day One和Markdown版本的条目。它还可以记录每天的天气情况。虽然还没有实现查询数据集的功能，但作者认为通过统计分析可以对数据进行跟踪和相关性分析。通过这个工具，作者能够获得自己的情绪和日志的概览。希望这个工具能对其他人也有帮助。 <div>
<p>I recently started couple’s therapy to try and improve the often-complicated relationship between myself (ADHD, bipolar) and my partner (autistic) and all of the unique problems that combination of neurodivergence presents. As part of this, I was asked to keep a journal containing certain data points. I started off journaling in Day One, but immediately realized that I was collecting some numeric data that I wouldn’t be able to do anything with unless it was stored in a database format of some kind. So I wrote a tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/journal-cli/">Journal</a> is a command-line tool that takes a configuration of journals, sections, and questions, presents the questions on the command line, and records the answers to JSON, as well as optionally creating Day One and Markdown versions of the entries. It can handle numeric data, string and multiline input, as well as automatically recording the daily weather for each entry.</p>

<p>To use it you need <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum">Gum</a> installed (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install gum</code>). If you want to use the Day One integration, you’ll also need to <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/command-line-interface-cli/">install the Day One CLI</a>. Those are the only prerequisites. You can just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code> to get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journal</code> command set up. It can handle multiple journal configurations and multiple output formats. It takes some configuration, but it’s very flexible (and will probably get more flexible as new needs arise).</p>

<p>I haven’t written the part of this that can query the datasets created yet. That’s going to be pretty individualized based on your needs, but I think everything should be there in the JSON to allow tracking and correlations with a little statistical analysis work. I’ll dig into it more once I’ve collected enough data. In the meantime, it’s also creating nicely-formatted Day One entries so I can get an overview of my moods and journals.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/journal-cli/">project page</a> for details on setup and configuration. Hopefully others will find this useful, too!</p>

<title>A bit more na work</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16322833/a-bit-more-na-work</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16322833/a-bit-more-na-work</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I went on a trip to Minneapolis this weekend. It went really well; I saw some 
great friends, ate some great food, and spent some early mornings coding at the hotel. I was just coding to kill time when I couldn’t sleep, and playing with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code></a> seemed like the perfect way to do it.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was take a second stab at “decomposing” the main binary so that each command had its own file, just to make maintenance easier. Finally got that working properly. It won’t change anything for the user, but it’s so much nicer <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/na_gem/tree/main/bin/commands">to look at</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> commands I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/08/22/some-na-updates-and-new-commands/">added last week</a>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> command now has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--restore</code> flag that can be used to remove the @done tag from an action or actions. It’s the same as using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--remove done</code>, but I find it just a little more intuitive. This flag is mirrored as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na restore [SEARCH]</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na unfinish [SEARCH]</code>) command.</p>

<p>I also added pagination, so for output that is longer than your screen, it will now pause using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code> if available, letting you page through with shortcut keys. This also applies to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help</code> command, so it’s easier to wade through the extensive documentation that the command provides. You can disable this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na --no-pager [COMMAND]</code>, a setting which can be saved to your config.</p>

<p>I added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na completed</code> command to view @done actions. It accepts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--before</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--on</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--after</code> flags that recognize natural language dates and can be combined. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--tagged TAG</code> to find actions tagged with any combination of tags (use comma separated list or use the flag multiple times, include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> to make a tag mandatory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> to negate). Any arguments passed to the command will function as a tokenized text search. And, of course, you can run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--save [NAME]</code> to save a complex search for later use with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved</code> command.</p>

<p>Speaking of saved searches, I also changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saved</code> command to allow multiple saved searches to run at once. So now if you have a saved search for low priority and one for medium priority, you can run them both together with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved lowprio medprio</code> and get combined results.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--done</code> flag not working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code></li>
  <li>Missing descriptions in help examples</li>
  <li>When replacing a priority tag, remove any space before it the action text</li>
  <li>Detect @tags in search strings and convert them to tag search with comparisons</li>
</ul>

<title>Some na updates and new commands</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16308395/some-na-updates-and-new-commands</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16308395/some-na-updates-and-new-commands</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve updated <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">na</a> with some new stuff I thought I’d share.</p>

<p>First off, I wanted an easy way to archive all @done actions in one swoop without having to use a lot of flags and switches to locate them and move them. So I added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> command, which takes a search string as an argument, but also has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--done</code> switch that will archive all @done tasks. So you can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na archive --done</code>, select the file to affect if there are multiple available, and presto, “archive all finished” is done, just like in TaskPaper.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>NAME
    archive - Mark an action as @done and archive

SYNOPSIS

    na [global options] archive [command options] ACTION

COMMAND OPTIONS
    --all             - Act on all matches immediately (no menu)
    -d, --depth=DEPTH - Search for files X directories deep (default: 1)
    --done            - Archive all done tasks
    -e, --regex       - Interpret search pattern as regular expression
    --file=PATH       - Specify the file to search for the task (default: none)
    -n, --note        - Prompt for additional notes. Input will be appended to any existing note. If STDIN input (piped) is detected, it
                        will be used as a note.
    -o, --overwrite   - Overwrite note instead of appending
    --tagged=TAG      - Match actions containing tag. Allows value comparisons (may be used more than once, default: none)
    -x, --exact       - Match pattern exactly

EXAMPLE

    # Find "An existing task", mark @done if needed, and move to archive
    na archive "An existing task"</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> command that will add a @done tag to whatever action matches your search (menu provided for multiple results), or all matches using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--all</code> switch. It’s basically a shortcut for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --finish SEARCH_STRING</code>. It’s aliased as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finish</code> as well. Both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> commands have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--note</code> switch that allows you to add a note (prompted if there’s nothing piped to it). All of the matching options from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> command are available, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--tagged</code> for searching by tag and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--regex</code> for doing a regular expression search. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--archive</code> switch that will simultaneously add a @done tag and move the action to the Archive.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>NAME
    complete - Find and mark an action as @done

SYNOPSIS

    na [global options] complete [command options] ACTION

<title>Convert RegExRX native files to Markdown snippets</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16306720/convert-regexrx-native-files-to-markdown-snippets</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16306720/convert-regexrx-native-files-to-markdown-snippets</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I <em>love</em> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/regexrx/id498370702?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">RegExRX</a> for testing regular expressions. It has all the features I could want from such an app, including the ability to copy a working regex out prepared for a range of languages. It’s what I’ve stuck with for years.</p>

<p>As I experiment with my regexes, I’ll save them in RegExRX, creating a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> file in my Snippets folder (where <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a> works). In order to make these searchable with Snibbets, I use a script to convert the XML-based <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> file to a Markdown file with the flags, search string, and the replace string and test text if they exist. I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/regexrx2md/">turned this into a gem</a> for anyone who should happen to run into such a need.</p>

<p>You can install the tool with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install regexrx2md</code>. Once installed, just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regexrx2md -o MARKDOWN_DIRECTORY SOURCE_DIRECTORY</code> to output a bunch of Markdown files from a directory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> files. You can also convert a single file just by providing a file link as the argument instead of a directory.</p>

<p>There are options for manipulating the filename, the Markdown template, and the output directory. See <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/regexrx2md/">the docs</a> for more info. While I hope this is useful to someone, it was something I useful enough to me to invest the time in, so it’s already paid off sufficiently. I just thought I’d share… just in case.</p>

<title>Kaleidoscope 4.1: Now with Git File History (and a special coupon) [Sponsor]</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to Kaleidoscope for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! The addition of Git History diffing is excellent, and I’m excited to share it with everybody.</p>

<p><a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" rel="nofollow">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

<p>Review versions of text and image files — and even folders full of files — with the world’s most powerful file comparison app. Kaleidoscope gives you powerful tools to use at each stage of the development cycle.</p>

<p>Now with version 4.1, Kaleidoscope continues to innovate by directly integrating with Git to show you a history for a single file. This makes it incredibly easy to track changes to a file over time. <a href="https://blog.kaleidoscope.app/2023/08/08/kaleidoscope-4-1-and-git/" rel="nofollow">Check out this blog post</a> for a detailed overview of how you can use this powerful new integration.</p>

<p>As Michael Tsai wrote: “… Kaleidoscope makes some of these tasks really easy. There are many ways to get it to open a single file, and then it automatically loads the history (and even the previous version, if you want). It’s easy to navigate the history to pick which versions you want to compare.  I’ve seen many different apps implement this type of interface, and Kaleidoscope’s version may be the best.”</p>

<p>Dave Verwer: “The UI of clicking through the history of a file with A and B buttons is simple and brilliant.”</p>

<p>In case you missed it, here are some of the most exciting features we added to Kaleidoscope with version 4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax coloring, with multiple built-in themes.</li>
  <li>Transform any comparison into a merge document that can be edited inline.</li>
  <li>Text filters to clean up diffs by removing irrelevant data, such as time stamps, object addresses and unique identifiers.</li>
  <li>Kaleidoscope Prism, a new helper app in the menu bar to quickly launch comparisons even if Kaleidoscope is not running.</li>
  <li>Debugger integration for Python developers.</li>
  <li>File properties show metadata, including size, file type, dates, and encoding.</li>
  <li>A welcome window that speeds up the processes of creating new comparisons or finding recent ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subscriptions start at $8 per month for a yearly plan. Use the coupon code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code> (valid until August 31, 2023) to get 20% off for the first year. <a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" rel="nofollow">Check it out today!</a></p>

<title>Orchard Resales: get yourself a Mac mini, cheap [Sponsor]</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to Orchard Resales for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! If you’re looking for an older Mac mini to use as a server or entertainment center, you can pick up used 2012/2014 models <em>dirt</em> cheap!</p>

<p><a href="https://orchardresales.com/collections/all" rel="nofollow">

            </a></p>

<p>I use a 2012 Mac mini as a basement server, running headless (no keyboard or monitor) and controlled over screen sharing. It runs Docker (and a few containers that give me things like network speed charts and VPN tunneling), Plex, and all of my home automation with all of my controllers hooked up to its USB ports. I also have a Synology, but you can easily set up file storage and serving with a Mac mini and a big external RAID drive. The one I run in my basement is a 2012 with a 500GB SSD and 16GB RAM. I’ve never needed to upgrade it any further to get everything I need out of it.</p>

<p>Want to set up your own, or have another use in mind for an old mini? Well, thanks to Orchard Resales you can pick one up for as little as $50 US. Deck one out with 16GB of RAM and an SSD and you’ll come out around $100. For a whole server, and it’s as easy to set up as using a Mac. And if you need spare parts, you can get non-functional Mac minis starting at just $15.</p>

<p>No, these can’t run the latest macOS, but for 99% of uses, they don’t need to, and if you’re really into it, you can use <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a> to get all the functionality you need.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://orchardresales.com/collections/all" rel="nofollow">Orchard Resales</a> today and get started with your own server! Or buy a bunch and make a server farm!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m afraid you’ve been seeing a lot of sponsored posts and not enough posts from me lately, so I thought I’d try to explain why.</p>

<p>After a relationship in my life was destabilized and I had an outsized reaction to it, I started trying to figure out what was going on with me. I was pointed toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder">Complex PTSD</a> and from there I discovered that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_trauma_syndrome">Religious Trauma Syndrome</a>, while not a part of the DSM, was a recognized thing, and that the causes and symptoms fit me perfectly.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last couple of weeks trying to unpack what this means for me. So much of the me I’ve come to know is explained by this: my attention issues, my memory problems, my emotional dysregulation, my drug addictions, and even my Bipolar Disorder can all be tied to RTS and CPTSD.</p>

<p>I grew up as a “different” kid in a fundamentalist church. As a young child I had urges and thoughts that I constantly feared would send me to hell. When I wasn’t worried about my eternal soul, I was worried about my non-Christian friends and <em>their</em> eternal souls. By the time I was in Middle School I was drinking and trying to cope with what amounts to a <em>constant</em> fight or flight response, in addition to grief.</p>

<p>Being neurodivergent, queer, and highly sensitive was not a good combination for me in the church I grew up in. And I was taught to put all of my value, all credit for my successes, and all forms of attachment into God, not earthly things. So when I decided the church wasn’t good for me (or, in my mind, for anyone), I had the secondary trauma of leaving. Becoming emotionally estranged from my family, losing my Christian friends, and losing a god, the one thing that I had ever believed could save me. I still have a lot to learn about attachment theory, but it’s safe to say that I never felt securely attached to any people in my life, from my earliest memories. Which, to be fair, are very sparse, because a symptom of CPTSD is amnesia, if I understand it correctly. I’ve always wondered why everyone else remembered so many things from their younger years and I only had occasional memories of moments. Not events, not periods, nothing substantial, only snippets. I couldn’t remember who was there, how I felt about them, only whether I felt safe or scared in that moment. And most of what I remember is feeling scared.</p>

<p>I started therapy with a new counselor last week. She actually has a psychology PhD and does trauma-informed therapy, and I think she’ll be much more helpful than my last therapist. I have high hopes. All I know is that if it doesn’t work out I absolutely have to keep working to find a good fit, because this shit is more than I know how to deal with on my own, and I can’t expect the people in my life to deal with it for me. All of my insecurities have been laid bare, I’m reacting to the world from a raw and frightened place non-stop, and it’s exhausting. I need to learn how to find security, validation, and love within myself and not depend on external sources just to exist. And that’s something I never learned how to do as a Christian. It’s been 30 years since I stopped believing, and I’m still not a whole person.</p>

<p>I’m an atheist these days, and it was a hard fought battle against my ingrained thoughts. I declared myself agnostic in my late teens, but it seriously took 20 years for me to stop looking over my shoulder and wondering if I was making a serious mistake that would <em>definitely</em> doom me to eternity in Hell. I’m over that now, I think, but I still watch anti-theist YouTube all the time, and it makes me wonder if part of me is still scared. I don’t have any interest in the god of the Bible — he’s a real asshole. And I was raised to believe that any other version of God was heresy — even other sects of Christians were going to hell. If you didn’t worship the specific version of God that was defined by my church, you were going to burn. So if I can’t accept that religion, then there’s no religion that would calm my nervous system. It was trained into me as a child. I’m constitutionally incapable of having Faith (capital F), and I was taught that without Faith you’re doomed, and now I’m just trying to put it all behind me. I’m flailing a bit.</p>

<p>I had to tell my parents I couldn’t see them for Saturday morning breakfast for a while. They’ve always been kind to me. They (and their friends) have prayed for my eternal soul. They raised me the way they were raised and I don’t blame them for repeating the trauma. But every time I see them I’m re-traumatized and I didn’t realize what was happening until now. I’ve been to the hospital multiple times with heart problems, and guess what? It was almost always within 24 hours of having breakfast with my parents. I’ve decided that’s not a coincidence. They were very understanding, and I really believe they want the best for me, I just can’t disassociate them from my childhood trauma. Hopefully I can let go of that and reestablish a relationship with my parents.</p>

<p>So that’s why I haven’t been writing. I’ve been trying to grapple with 45 years of fear I had successfully avoided until now. I’ll be back. I’m reading, I’m going to therapy, I’m working to understand and develop tools for moving forward. I’m going to be stronger for having all of this laid bare and being forced to deal with it.</p>

<title>BetterTouchTool: Introducing floating menus [Sponsor]</title>

<p>Thanks to BetterTouchTool for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! I am a <em>huge</em> fan of BetterTouchTool and use it all day every day on my Mac. I wouldn’t know what to do without it. From customizing my keyboard shortcuts to adding infinite gestures to my trackpad to running my entire Stream Deck setup, there’s nothing this little utility can’t do.</p>

            </a></p>

<p>I think BetterTouchTool is well known to readers of this blog (thanks Brett!), so I won’t go into the details of the many things you can do with it. Instead I want to promote a powerful new feature that has been added to BTT recently and is currently in beta phase: Floating Menus.</p>

<p>Imagine them as highly flexible, widget-like menus that you can place virtually anywhere on your screen.  You can attach them to specific positions in specific windows, to specific screens, the current mouse position and many more. You can specify whether they float on top, stick them to your desktop or have them behave like normal windows (and more). </p>

<p>They can always be visible, expand on mouse hover or be shown/hidden via any trigger in BTT.</p>

<p>A Floating Menu contains either standard buttons, or widgets like sliders or even web view items. Their appearance is completely customizable. All items are fully scriptable via AppleScript or Javascript, and soon there will be a plugin system to load custom widgets.</p>

<p>The Floating Menus will soon become the basis for numerous existing BetterTouchTool features, such as Stream Deck and Notch Bar support and several predefined actions. These will gradually transition to utilize the Floating Menu rendering and scripting engine making them more flexible and robust by streamlining maintenance &amp; future development.</p>

<p>Additionally, the upcoming (entirely new) version of the iOS BTT Remote app will be capable of rendering your custom Floating Menus on your iPhone or iPad. </p>

<p>You can find various Floating Menu examples on <a href="https://share.folivora.ai" rel="nofollow">share.folivora.ai</a>. For example have a look at the Notch menu, which is invisible by default but expands from your Macbook’s Notch on hover. Another nice example is the “Mini Emoji Menu” preset: it places a little transparent dot on the left edge of the active window, which, when hovered, shows multiple custom emoji which you can insert by clicking.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.folivora.ai/docs/1600_floating_menus.html" rel="nofollow">documentation for this new feature</a> is already available, and you can always come to <a href="https://community.folivora.ai/c/floatingmenus/18" rel="nofollow">the community site</a> to discuss or request features. Now that I have a solid working base, I can easily built on it, so please report any bugs and request any feature you can think of!</p>

<title>Sanebox, your email concierge [Sponsor]</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I’ve said before, I’m a long time user and lover of Sanebox. Thanks to them for sponsoring again this week. Here’s a user story from Thomas Yuan.</p>

<p><a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p>Well, here’s a funny thing: I started using SaneBox because my email was an utter disaster, and I needed something to save me from the deluge. Little did I know that I was stepping into a world where email isn’t just manageable, it’s… well, sane. I know, I know…</p>

<p>SaneBox is like having your own personal email concierge. It’s not just a filter - oh no, that’s underselling it. It’s like a highly-trained butler who goes through your mail, knows what’s important, and presents you with only the choicest pieces of correspondence.</p>

<p>Everything else? Neatly sorted away, out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p>Setting up SaneBox is as easy as pie. And I’m not talking about some complicated lattice-top apple pie here. I mean one of those simple, comforting pumpkin pies. You just connect your email account, and voila, SaneBox starts its magic. It learns from your actions, your patterns, tailoring its sorting to your specific needs.</p>

<p>Now, the main feature here is the @SaneLater folder. It’s like a second inbox, except it’s where all the non-urgent emails go to hang out. Newsletter from that one store you bought socks from 3 years ago? That’s a @SaneLater item. Automated system alert about a software update? You bet that’s going in @SaneLater.</p>

<p>What’s more, you can customize it to your heart’s content. There’s @SaneBlackHole for those pesky emails you never want to see again, and @SaneNews for newsletters and the like. You can even create your own folders, and SaneBox will learn to sort your emails accordingly.</p>

<p>And don’t get me started on @SaneReminders. Ever sent an email and needed a reminder if nobody replies? Just CC or BCC to 1week@sanebox.com, and if there’s no reply in a week, it pops back up in your inbox. It’s like a boomerang made out of pure organizational power.</p>

<p>Sure, there are other email management tools out there. But SaneBox stands out for its simplicity, its flexibility, and, most of all, its effectiveness. It’s like it took my unruly, wild-west email inbox and turned it into a sleek, streamlined, email-answering machine. And, in a world where every spare minute counts, who wouldn’t want that?</p>

<p>So, if you’ve got an email inbox that’s more like a black hole, give SaneBox a whirl. I promise you, you won’t be disappointed. It’s affordable, efficient, and pretty darn fun to use.</p>

<p>And here’s a pro tip: if you’re ever unsure about a feature, just explore their help center. It’s packed with useful guides and tips. It’s like the cherry on top of the SaneBox sundae.</p>

<p>SaneBox isn’t just a tool, it’s a lifestyle change. It’s a way to take back control of your inbox and, by extension, your digital life. It’s helped me, and I’m pretty sure it’ll help you too. So why wait? Start living the sane way today.</p>

<p>Sanebox is an inexpensive choice. You can get a free trial to experience the difference in email management without any commitment. Plus, the app offers flexible monthly plans starting at just $7.</p>

<p>My cat died a couple weeks ago. I had him for 20 years and he’s left a large hole in my life. I know not everybody gets cats the way cat people do, but he was honestly one of my closest friends. I just wanted to write a bit about him now that the grief is a bit less raw and just remember him for the legend he was.</p>

<p>My ex and I were around when Yeti’s mom had her litter. She had health problems and sadly had to be euthanized shortly after Yeti and his siblings were weaned. I had my pick of the litter. I had recently lost a tuxedo cat (Trouble) to a pit bull attack, and thought I’d take the one tuxedo in the litter. Aditi’s mom suggested I also take this one bashful kitten who had a hairline similar to mine. I agreed. Jezebel (the Tuxedo) became Aditi’s cat, and Yeti almost immediately became very bonded to me. I’ve always been thankful I was talked into taking him.</p>

<p>Both Yeti and Jezebel were polydactyl, and Yeti’s front paws had six toes each. I almost named him Big Foot, but given his long, thick white hair, “Yeti” seemed more apropos.</p>

<p>Yeti displayed what can only be anthropomorphized as “empathy.” He always understood when I was sad or sick and would lay by me, placing one paw on my thigh, or curl up on the couch behind me and put his paw on my shoulder. And when I was happy or comfortable, he would be in my lap. He loved to sit facing me with his paws on my chest and give me nose bumps. He learned very young that licking my nose repeatedly was a bit painful, and would just give one lick or tap and then stop.</p>

<p>Speaking of understanding pain, Yeti learned at a very young age that his claws and teeth hurt me, and after he got past the part of his life where he would try to climb my leg with his sharp little kitten claws, he never bit or scratched anybody, ever. I once held him while a urinary crystal was removed through his urethra; he held onto my arm and yowled, but never clawed or bit, which was impressive. I think if someone was squeezing a rock through my private bits I would probably try to bite the nearest arm I could.</p>

<p>Jezebel passed away under the care of Aditi a few years back. We honestly never expected Yeti to outlive her, but he lived to 19 years and 9 months and I enjoyed every minute of it. I’ve spent more time with Yeti than with any human in my entire life. He was always around. I never even saw my parents that much from 0-18. And I’ve never had a romantic relationship longer than about 13 years. So Yeti was my longest relationship and the “partner” I’ve spent the most of my life with. I appreciate humans and all, but Yeti and I never had a fight or even a misunderstanding. He was just always there for me. I gave him all my love, and he returned it.</p>

<p>Yeti has been living with my partner Elle and I for about 5 years now. It took him a while, but he eventually accepted Elle as his other person. He worked his way into her heart and Elle loved him as much as I did. He helped pull our little “family” together, and I know she’s missing him right now, too.</p>

<p>The last couple years have been full of health scares. He went from 20 pounds to 6 pounds at the end. He had a bout of pancreatitis, and then kidney failure. We’d been expecting him to die for quite a while now, so we had plenty of time to prepare for this. And he gave me the best ending I could imagine…</p>

<p>He was energetic and loving on Thursday, and then at 2am on Friday he crawled under my covers and fell asleep. That was the last time he moved on his own. He spent the day with me Friday, with his paw in my hand or on my leg. I would place him in the middle of the couch and then work on my laptop on the side, and he would pull himself over to me to put his paw on me or bury his head in my thigh. I took him to bed with me that night. On Saturday at 5:15am, I rolled over and put my hand on him. He took two deep breaths and then exhaled his last. Man, he waited until I woke up to say goodbye. Seriously, he was the most caring cat you’ll ever meet.</p>

<p>I will always miss Yeti, but he gave me a great 20 years in the prime of my life. I’m not nearly as devastated as I thought I’d be. It was all so peaceful. He stayed by me all the way to the end, and I’ll be eternally grateful that he passed peacefully at home and I didn’t have to make the decision to end his life in a cold vet’s office. I’ve done that with beloved pets a dozen times over the years, and it’s a horrible thing to go through. Yeti gave me a fairy tale of an ending.</p>

<p>I made a video out of 20 years’ worth of pictures. It’s too long, but if you want to enjoy it and have the patience for it, consider it my tribute to the best cat ever.</p>

<title>Snibbets 2.0.34</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16195268/snibbets-2-dot-0-34</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16195268/snibbets-2-dot-0-34</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I released a new version of
<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a> this morning that solves one
peculiarity: if you have multiple snippets in one file but any of them
don’t contain code blocks, then the titles and display would get weird.</p>

<p>Now you can have sections of a snippet file (separated by ATX headers)
that contain just notes. If a section contains just notes and no code,
then the notes will be output for that section, even when not using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--notes</code> or having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all_notes: true</code> set in config.</p>

<p>This just allows for uses of Snibbets as both a note reference and a
snippet manager. It probably won’t effect people who are using it “as
intended,” but opens up new use cases.</p>

<p>To get the latest version, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install snibbets</code>. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">project
page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>Doing with multiple sections</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16160573/doing-with-multiple-sections</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16160573/doing-with-multiple-sections</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Funny story: I got a feature request for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a> to allow multiple sections to be specified in the output, but I misread the notification as a request for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/" title="doing - BrettTerpstra.com">Doing</a>. So I spent a couple hours adding multiple section handling to an array of Doing commands and happily reported the result to the user, who was very confused by the version number I gave him. I apologized and have now added multiple section handling to mdless, which was a <em>lot</em> less work than adding it to Doing. So I might as well write a blog post about the Doing feature nobody asked for, I guess.</p>

<p>Most of Doing’s many commands allow for the specification of a particular section, e.g. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show</code> command can limit its results to just one section, or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag</code> command can tag the last X entries from a given section. Now, almost all of these commands can take multiple sections, either specified as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s section1,section2</code> or by using multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s</code> flags in the same command, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing show -s currently -s later</code>.</p>

<p>This allows a little more flexibility, especially for display commands. It also means you can perform actions on a more limited set of entries without limiting it to just a single set. It (obviously) doesn’t apply to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">now</code> command or other entry commands because an entry can only be in one section.</p>

<p>By the way, section names are fuzzy matched, so you can specify that you want results from both Currently and Later (assuming you have such sections) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s curr,lat</code>.</p>

<p>If I expand this further, I’ll allow negative arguments as well, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing show -s -archive</code> to exclude the Archive section. But for now it’s just multiple sections.</p>

<p>That’s all for now, just figured I’d mention it since I put the effort into it. You can update to the latest with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install doing</code> (which might require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code>, depending on your setup).</p>

<p>This post will only be of interest to those using the <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a> (<abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr>), specifically with the lefthand <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/product/keycluster">key cluster module</a>. I recently added some customizations I thought might be worth mentioning to those who happen to have this setup. For those who don’t, maybe read on and be tempted by the possibilities…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent">Agent software</a> for the <abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr> allows the definition of up to four additional Function layers, or sets of keys that are mapped when a modifier is held down. You’re probably used to the Mod layer, which is how you turn I/J/K/L into arrow keys, etc. when you hold the Mod key, and the Fn layer, which turns 1 into F1 when you hold the Fn key. By clicking the down arrow on the layer bar, you can now check boxes next to Fn2-Fn5 layers to enable them. Then you can assign keys to trigger them, which is where the key cluster module comes in.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="enable-layers-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="315" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/enable-layers-800.jpg" title="enable-layers-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The key cluster module provides 3 extra keys to the right of your B key and Space key (by default it’s the Mod key, but I swap my Mod and Space keys). I initially assigned these to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> on the top (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-B"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">B</kbd></span> when Mod is held, creating Run and Build buttons in Xcode and other IDEs, and a Refresh button in most other apps), and Enter and Backspace on the bottom two keys (Numpad Return and Forward Delete when Mod or Fn is held). But then I realized they could further function as triggers for other layers.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            

<p>You can assign a secondary function to any key, which is an action that’s performed when it’s held while another key is pressed. For example, I change the default Mouse key into Caps Lock (which becomes my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2015/12/18/a-hyper-key-that-can-still-yell/" title="A Hyper Key that can still YELL">Hyper key</a> along with <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" title="Karabiner-Elements">Karabiner Elements</a>), and use the secondary function on the Tab key so that when it’s held in combination with other keys, it triggers the Mouse layer.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="tab-mouse.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="426" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/tab-mouse.jpg" title="tab-mouse.jpg" width="689" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The bottom left key of the module is a very natural reach for the left thumb, and was the first layer I created. I added a Fn2 layer, and then assigned the secondary function of that key to trigger the Fn2 layer when held. Now I can map anything on the right side, and on the left side I can map anything easily reached by my remaining fingers when my left thumb is holding the module key down.</p>

<p>I assigned A-G (home row) keys to F20-F24, which I then use with BetterTouchTool to trigger actions. I also assigned the block of keys from Y-O down to N-. on the right side to produce characters I commonly use in coding, such as curly/square/angle brackets. It took a while to get used to using those instead of reaching for the actual keys, but it does speed things up with a little practice.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="fn2keymap-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="396" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/fn2keymap-800.jpg" title="fn2keymap-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />

              </noscript>
            
<p>Then I added a Fn3 layer, and made it so that when the right bottom button of the module was held, the other two buttons turn into PgUp and PgDown, and B and Space turn into Home and End. This is essentially the same as holding down my (repositioned) right Mod key and using the arrow cluster on my right hand, but gives me easy one-handed left-handed scrolling while my right hand is on the trackpad. I haven’t added anything else to that layer yet.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="fwd-back.jpg" class="alignright" height="229" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/fwd-back.jpg" title="fwd-back.jpg" width="272" />
              </noscript>
            
<p>The top key on the module triggers the Fn4 layer, which simply turns the bottom two keys into <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-["><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">[</kbd></span> and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-]"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">]</kbd></span> for forward back navigation.</p>

<p>I’ll expand the Fn3/4 keymaps as I find needs for them, but one step at a time. I’ve made the mistake of programming complex layers (and entire other keymaps) and then having to make extensive cheat sheets to remember where everything is until I develop muscle memory for them.</p>

<p>Bonus tip: The Fn layer by default only affects the number keys, so there’s a whole lot of room for mapping other functions to letter keys. I turn a block of keys on the right to be media controls:</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="media-keys.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="351" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/media-keys.jpg" title="media-keys.jpg" width="459" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>I hope that provides some interesting ideas for your own customizations. If you’re interested in this kind of thing but haven’t looked into the <abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr>, I highly recommend <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">checking it out</a>. Splurge on the wrist wrests and the key module!</p>

<p>Not so long ago I wrote a little script that would generate an HTML playground of any MacOS app’s menu bar, primarily for the purpose of generating screenshots. It has a full automation API and you can script screenshots with fuzzy name matching, meaning menu items names and positions can change and your automated screenshots will still work. It’s a very specific use case, but I shared it because it took way too much time and I would love it if it helped even one other person.</p>

<p>Yesterday I updated the menu styling to match Ventura, which uses new submenu indicators, slightly smaller font sizes by default, and slight changes to background opacity and hue. The results should look like a passable rendition of the latest operating system now. You can <a href="https://ttscoff.github.io/niftymenu/Pages.html">check out the demo here</a>.</p>

<p>NiftyMenu also got <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/niftymenu">its own project page</a> on this site, with full documentation and installation instructions.</p>

<p>Thanks to SaneBox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I don’t know what I would do without it.</p>

<p>Ever feel like you’re drowning in a sea of emails? You’re not alone. We know the struggle of managing important emails while fighting spam messages with flashy sales. For every 10 emails from sources you don’t even remember subscribing to, you get one important one. When you find it, it feels like you’ve already finished a long task, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Finding important messages shouldn’t feel like a battle between you and your inbox. In fact, why do you have to sort through all these unimportant files in the first place?</p>

<p>In a world of relentless digital communication, email overload is a common struggle. But SaneBox can help you to conquer your inbox once and for all! Using AI, SaneBox learns your email habits and sorts incoming messages precisely, so you can achieve the ultimate victory: a perfectly organized inbox.</p>

<p>Let’s explore this service in a quick overview!</p>

<h3 id="why-sanebox-stands-out">Why SaneBox Stands Out</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI-Powered:</strong> SaneBox’s algorithms learn your email behavior and customize your inbox management experience. So, if you want to see your favorite brand’s discounts in the same inbox as your collaborator’s messages, you’ve got it!</li>
  <li><strong>Personalized Prioritization:</strong> High-priority emails stay in your main inbox, while lower-priority messages move to a separate folder for later review.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus-Driven Features:</strong> With tools like Do Not Disturb, you can pause incoming emails and concentrate on your tasks without distractions. You can come back to them whenever you’re ready.</li>
  <li><strong>Universal Compatibility:</strong> SaneBox works with any email service. So whether you’re using Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook, you can tame that inbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-sanebox-features">Key SaneBox Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Smart Filtering:</strong> Automatically sorts emails based on your habits and priorities as soon as they reach your inbox. It’s like having a personal assistant to filter your inbox (but without the awkward daily interactions).</li>
  <li><strong>SaneNoReplies:</strong> Tracks messages you’ve sent without a response, making it easy to follow up.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Folders:</strong> Organize your emails effortlessly with custom-made folders for all your categories and priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to pricing, Sanebox is an inexpensive choice. You can get a free trial to experience the difference in email management without any commitment. Plus, the app offers flexible monthly plans starting at just $7. It’s really that affordable!</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a> to handle this blog’s RSS feeds. It reads my statically-generated RSS feed and gives me subscriber stats, as well as the ability to send new posts to social media endpoints. But it lacks Mastodon integration, and I’m spending most of my time on Mastodon lately (find me at <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff" title="Mastodon/ttscoff@nojack.easydns.ca">@ttscoff@nojack.easydns.ca</a>). So I wanted my new posts on this blog to automatically post to Mastodon. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">script in this post</a> could be used with any blog that generates an RSS feed, but is mostly geared toward static blogs.</p>

<p>I got started with a post from Dr. Drang called <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2022/11/announcing-new-posts-on-mastodon/">“Announcing New Posts on Mastodon”</a>. It included a Python script that I referenced to create a Ruby script for my needs. Thanks to the Doc for getting me started!</p>

<p>You can find the script <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">here</a>. See below for configuration and usage.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<p>To configure the script, at minimum, you need your Mastodon endpoint and an auth key. Your endpoint is generally your Mastodon instance URL with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/v1/statuses</code> appended to it, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://mastodon.social/api/v1/statuses</code>. I’m not sure if this is ever not the case. The auth key can be generated by going to your Mastodon homepage, clicking the Settings gear icon, and choosing Development. Create a new application with any name, your blog url as the website, and leave the Redirect URI as is. Make sure it at least has permission to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write:statuses</code>. You’ll then see a client key, a client secret, and an access token. All you need is the access token for this script.</p>

<p>Set up the script by updating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTODON_ENDPOINT</code> (as described above) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTODON_AUTH</code> (with your access token).</p>

<p>You’ll also need to configure the RSS feed. The script can parse JSON or XML feeds of your blog (local files or URLs) to find the latest post. If you want to use a JSON feed, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON_FEED</code> to either a local JSON file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> is fine for your HOME directory) or a JSON feed url. If you’re using an XML feed, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON_FEED</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, and set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSS_FEED</code> to either a local file or url. With FeedPress, my JSON is generated from my XML and both feeds can take a few minutes to update, and the most immediate list of posts I have is the local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom.xml</code> file generated with my site, so that’s what I have mine set to. That way I can run this script immediately after a new deploy and still get the latest post.</p>

<p>The rest of the settings in the script are the template used for the status (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST_TEMPLATE</code>), an optional query string that can be appended to the URL for campaign tracking, etc. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUERY_STRING</code>), and then a few options for updating front matter. I imagine most people won’t need the front matter bit, but the options are commented if you need them.</p>

<p>It records what it posts to a local JSON file (location set with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TOOTS_DB</code>), so it won’t post the same thing twice. Optionally, it can go back and add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mastodon: [TOOT_URL]</code> key to the original Markdown for the post. I’m using this to render a Mastodon link on each post that links to the toot so that people can reply/share it from their Mastodon account (since Mastodon doesn’t/can’t offer a “Toot This” link the way Twitter can, as far as I know)<sup id="fnref:js"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:js" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. For most people this step is probably unnecessary, and can be disabled entirely by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADD_FRONT_MATTER</code> constant at the top of the script to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>All of the necessary config is commented, should be pretty easy to get running. Rather than rely on Ruby’s Net/HTTP library, it just uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> to make the call, so you need a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> binary available (this is default on most systems).</p>

<p>To use the script, save it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toot.rb</code> and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x toot.rb</code> on it. If properly configured, you can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb</code> to toot the latest post from your feed. If you want to test, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--debug</code> (or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d</code>), and it will set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibility=direct</code> parameter that will make the resulting Mastodon post show up only for you (private).</p>

<p>You can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb --last-ten</code> to toot the last 10 posts. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb -h</code> to see available options.</p>

<p>By default, when the script creates a new toot, it will notify you on STDERR. It will also output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW_TOOT: [TOOT_URI]</code> to STDOUT, which is what I use to detect whether a new toot was created and trigger a rebuild. You can disable all output with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--silent</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s</code>).</p>

<h3 id="updating-front-matter">Updating Front Matter</h3>

<p>If you want to use the front matter updating “as is” in the script, it requires that your blog posts be named to match the url. It takes the url path, substitutes slashes for dashes, and removes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and any trailing slash from the url to create the slug, then adds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. So if your post is at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/2023/04/21/im-on-shrooms-like-right-now/</code>, the resulting file it will look for is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2023-04-21-im-on-shrooms-like-right-now.md</code>. If your naming scheme is anything else, it would require manual editing to work.</p>

<p>For reference, I have this script run as part of my Rakefile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:deploy</code> task. Once the site is fully deployed, it runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toot.rb</code> and toots the latest post. If the script returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW_TOOT</code> on STDOUT (meaning the post has never been tooted before and the front matter for the tooted post has been updated), it will re-render and deploy the site again so that the Mastodon link on the newest post goes live. Presumably, although that’s about to be tested when I publish this post. It’s a bit of a hacky workaround, but I can’t toot it until the post is live, and I can’t get the Mastodon link until it’s tooted, so it takes twice to get it right. It will only ever toot a post once, so updates and re-renders won’t be doubled.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:generate_deploy</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<h3 id="in-closing">In Closing</h3>

<p>I hope that FeedPress eventually adds Mastodon sharing to its social services, but my current setup really likes having the actual URL for the associated Mastodon post available, so that wouldn’t do much good in this scenario anyway. I hope this script is helpful to other people using static blog setups and wanting Mastodon integration.</p>

<p>If you do generate your own RSS feed and don’t currently get statistics from it, I do recommend checking out <a href="https://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a>. It’s affordable, and great for blogs and podcasts.</p>

<p>Again, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">find the script in this gist</a>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:js">
      <p>I considered just using JavaScript to load the JSON record that this script creates and inject a Mastodon link on the front end (avoiding multiple renders), but for a few reasons decided I’d rather add a hardcoded link at render time. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:js">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Markdown to Bike conversion</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16078222/markdown-to-bike-conversion</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16078222/markdown-to-bike-conversion</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m liking outlining in Jesse Grossjean’s latest app, <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/">Bike</a>, for my outlining needs. It’s a simple outliner that can save the content of its outlines to Bike files, OPML documents, or plain text. And its native document format is plain HTML that’s easy to work with.</p>

<p>As an aside, Jesse just released Shortcut actions for Bike, making it possible to do some automation of Bike and Bike documents. I haven’t played around with it much yet, but if you’re into Shortcuts, <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/bike-automate-with-shortcuts/">check out what’s available</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that Bike lacks is an easy way to convert Markdown lists to Bike outlines. It can actually read indented plain text just fine, but the list markers are included in the node text, and blank lines become empty nodes instead of being compressed. Running a list through a Markdown processor and saving as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bike</code> can often create an invalid file, as Bike requires every list item to contain a paragraph tag, not bare text.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I initially played around with running Markdown through a Markdown processor and then manipulating the output, but ultimately went with a much simpler version that compresses newlines and removes list markers, putting the resulting indented text in your clipboard. Pasting the result into a Bike document should almost always yield the expected result.</p>

              </noscript>
            

<p>Save the script below as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md_to_bike</code> in your PATH and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x path/to/md_to_bike</code>. It can be called as a pipe or on a file. To call it as a pipe, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat myfile.md | md_to_bike</code>. To call it on a file, just provide the path to the file as an argument: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mmd_to_bike path/to/myfile.md</code>. The results will be placed in your clipboard, ready to paste into a Bike document.</p>

<p>Over 20 years of writing scripts and apps I’ve collected a lot of “snippets” of code that I save whenever I solve a problem and think I’ll want the solution again in the future. I like these snippets to include notes and links, and I need to be able to easily search them and grab the code when I need it without much effort. That’s why I wrote Snibbets <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/04/29/markdown-and-code-snippet-management/">back in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve now refactored Snibbets as a gem and vastly improved its capabilities. I wanted the simplicity of creating snippets in nvUltra and searching them quickly from the command line, getting just the code I need with a few keystrokes. I keep iTerm in Visor mode, so it’s a hotkey away, and just as convenient as any quick find panel in a dedicated snippet management app.</p>

<p>Snibbets now has <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">its own project page</a> where you can read all about its features and options. You can also see all the code, file bug reports, and make feature requests <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/snibbets">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Here’s a quick overview, though.</p>

<h3 id="snippets-are-markdown-files">Snippets Are Markdown Files</h3>

<p>A snippet is just a Markdown file, where the filename becomes the title, optionally with additional extensions that help the syntax highlighter, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">symbolize hash keys.rb.md</code>. The document can contain tags in MultiMarkdown metadata format, titles as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> headlines, additional notes, and the code snippet either indented or fenced with optional language specifier. A single document can contain multiple snippets, separated with headlines as titles for each one.</p>

<p>Snippets all go into one folder. You don’t need to organize them into directories, that would defeat the purpose of the full text search in Snibbets. You can open that directory in any app that can handle it, such as nvUltra or Obsidian, and have full access for editing and creating new snippets.</p>

              </video>
            </figure>

<h3 id="searching-your-snippets">Searching Your Snippets</h3>

<p>To search your snippets, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets SEARCH TERMS</code>. It will use a combination of Spotlight, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to find matches. If there’s more than one match, you’ll get a menu, and if the selected file contains more than one snippet, you’ll get a second menu. The code from the snippet is output to the console without any accompanying notes.</p>

<p>You can run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--edit</code> to open the selected snippet in your editor to see all of the notes or update the code. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--nvultra</code> to open the snippet in nvUltra, assuming you’re on the beta. You can also run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--copy</code> to copy just the code to your clipboard in addition to displaying it in the console. Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets -h</code> to see all available options.</p>

<h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3>

<p>When multiple results/snippets are detected, a menu is generated. If you have <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" title="junegunn/fzf:A command-line fuzzy finder">fzf</a> installed, it will be used for the menu, allowing fuzzy searching to narrow results. If you don’t have fzf but do have <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum" title="charmbracelet/gum:A tool for glamorous shell scripts 🎀">gum</a> installed, that will be used and is almost as good for this purpose. Failing that, Snibbets will generate its own menu and you’ll have to enter a number to get the snippet. fzf and gum are far superior, so I recommend installing one or the other.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<p>I put a lot of time into syntax highlighting. You can use either Pygments or Skylighting (separate installations), and you can configure the theme. Syntax definitions are picked up from the filename and from language specifiers on fenced code blocks. It looks really great using Skylighting and the Nord theme (as shown in the video above). To enable this, edit your config (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets --configure</code>) to include:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">highlight</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
<span class="na">highlighter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">skylighting</span>
<span class="na">highlight_theme</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">nord</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Snibbets will avoid highlighting anything going to the clipboard or being piped or redirected to other commands. Keeps things tidy.</p>

<p>It’s a simple tool<sup id="fnref:simple"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:simple" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but it makes it feasible for me to store all of my code snippets in a way that allows nvUltra to become my main code snippet manager, and gives me instant access to any snippet from the command line. Just what I needed.</p>

<title>Syntax highlighting is fun, and you won't believe this one weird trick</title>

<p>Over the last couple of days I got obsessed with wrangling my code snippet collection, once again. It’s not healthy, but it is what it is. I dug back into Snibbets, a tool for managing code snippets as plain text Markdown files that <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/04/29/markdown-and-code-snippet-management/">I started back in 2020</a>. I actually got it to a really good point today, but I’m realizing that it’s getting bloated enough that it needs to become a gem before I’m ready to hype it up. The current version and mostly-up-to-date documentation are <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/snibbets">up on GitHub</a>, though, so feel free to peek in the meantime.</p>

<p>But that’s not what I’m here to tell you about. In the process of working on Snibbets, I wrote a little routine that could turn a file extension into a programming language name for tagging purposes, and vice versa. It seemed ripe for making a little one-off utility, so I’ve <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/14560a71b86a48b4d895087d3700f516">posted a standalone version to GitHub</a>. I’m going to be using it when I’m doing technical writing and including code samples in languages I don’t usually work with. When you create a fenced code block, you can add a “lexer” to the opening fence, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~~ruby</code>, which helps most platforms with properly syntax highlighting it. But then I find myself working on someone else’s Terraform code and I’m unsure whether that’s a supported language for syntax highlighting. Now I can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexers.rb terraform</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexers.rb tf</code> and it will tell me all about it. What the available lexers are, what common extensions are associated with it, you know, the works.</p>

<p>I built this by taking the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmentize -L lexers</code> and running it through a few regular expressions to make a parseable data set. Then I took the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skylighting -l</code> to add a few more lexers (though those don’t have extensions listed and I don’t know many of the more obscure ones, so that data serves to search for a valid lexer, but nothing else). The script itself just builds a queryable object out of the data and offers a few different ways to get at the data (you can see the whole set at the bottom of the script). The easiest way to use it is like I mentioned above: just pass a file extension or language name to it as an argument and it will give you back the info you need. There’s more documentation in the comments of the script.</p>

<p>Just thought I’d share it! <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/14560a71b86a48b4d895087d3700f516">Check out the gist</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<title>I forgot about the Titlecase API</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16070204/i-forgot-about-the-titlecase-api</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16070204/i-forgot-about-the-titlecase-api</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I made a little web service back in 2015 and somewhere in the following 7 years I forgot about it. I’ve been adding title-casing to various projects and plugins and keep writing new code for it… which was the whole reason I built the API to begin with.</p>

<p>It just accepts a text string and returns an AP titlecased version as plain text. That’s it. No bells or whistles, but if you need to incorporate title casing into a script or a Shortcut or anything else that can make a quick call to the web, it’s a great answer.</p>

<p>Just make a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/?title=the%20text%20to%20titlecase</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title=</code> contains the url encoded string you want to title case. You can play with it <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/test">on the test page</a>, which will also show you the url to use to get the same result.</p>

<p>That’s all. It’s a silly little thing, but if I’ve forgotten about it, I bet everyone else did, too, and it might just be handy for someone.</p>

<title>Just checking in</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16068629/just-checking-in</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16068629/just-checking-in</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I haven’t been posting much besides sponsored posts and web excursions for a while now. I figured it was time for a checkin for the sake of those who check this blog regularly, and especially for the benefit of those who <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/support/">offer financial support</a> to me and all my projects.</p>

<p>As you probably know, I have bipolar disorder. Most of my project releases and blogging spurts correlate with manic episodes. And manic episodes are bad for me — they result in a severe sleep deficit that is shortening my life. But I’ve been remarkably stable lately, the downside of which is no late night coding/creating binges or the inescapable bursting of ideas that I just have to share with the world. It means I do my job, I maintain and support my commercial software, I fix reported bugs in my free projects, and I go to bed. It doesn’t lead to a lot of fun software releases, blog posts, or new ideas in general. Sleep is good, stagnation kills me.</p>

<p>I’ve recently been realizing that my version of “stable” is more akin to depression. The thing is, I can’t take antidepressants without risking triggering a manic phase, which leaves me in a position where I either have to be depressed, or deal with the life-shortening effects of constant mood fluctuation. But I think I have a potential solution…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>I removed the meat of this post because it was causing friction with my loved ones. I don’t want my activities to cause any undue harm, so I’ll save further sharing on this topic until everything is… decriminalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>So that’s my check-in for now. You can hear more up-to-the-minute updates on my progress (as well as Jeff and Christina’s) by tuning into the Mental Health Corner on <a href="https://overtiredpod.com/">Overtired</a>. I appreciate all of the support (monetary, pull requests, and even just kind emails) that you all have continued to provide for me. It really helps me stay motivated to maintain my 100+ projects and create new stuff!</p>

<title>Find which of your favorite apps are on Setapp, revisited</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16056931/find-which-of-your-favorite-apps-are-on-setapp-revisited</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16056931/find-which-of-your-favorite-apps-are-on-setapp-revisited</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Back in 2019 I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/22/so-you-got-setapp-dot-dot-dot-make-the-most-of-it/">wrote a little script</a> that would parse your Applications folder and tell you which of your apps were available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a>. The goal was to help you figure out which apps you were already using that were also on Setapp, so you could use the Setapp version and direct a little of your subscription fee to your favorite developers.</p>

<p>The script parses the setapps/apps page to see what apps are available, and the markup has changed since I originally wrote the script. Thankfully, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cplater/110138170935239070#.">Chuck Plater</a> updated the script <a href="https://gist.github.com/caplater/96467af7041f34367895b7b1170f5589">in a fork</a> to work with the current markup. I’ve implemented his changes in <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/70f6dec1fa12d96c8af3f8b5b3b7e14b">the original script</a> and it’s once again working fine.</p>

<p>To use the script, save it to a text file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onsetapp.rb</code>, then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x onsetapp.rb</code> on it. Once you’ve done that, you should be able to execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./onsetapp.rb</code> and get a list of applications you use that are also available on Setapp.</p>

<p>Thanks to Chuck for the fix. I hope all Setapp subscribers will go to the trouble of using the Setapp version of apps they already own, it really does help the developers (and this script makes it easy). If you’re not already a Setapp user, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">here’s my affiliate link</a> to start using hundreds of apps for $10 a month.</p>

<p>Thanks to Curio for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week!</p>

<p>What if your digital notebook allowed you to create at-a-glance dashboards and checklists using queries to pull in and consolidate information from all across your project into lists, mind maps, or Kanban collections?</p>

<p>We call them <em>Smart Collections</em> and that’s what we’re introducing in <a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Curio 25 Professional</a>, the latest release of our flagship note-taking and brainstorming app for macOS.</p>

<p>Create a new list, mind map, or Kanban stack then specify a query expression. Immediately it will dynamically fill itself with matching figures from across your notebook. A query can be as simple as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">starts soon</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#remind</code> or as sophisticated as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(@george priority&gt;4) or due&lt;2w or #active group:priority</code>.</p>

<p>Even better, these dynamic collections contain <em>live</em> instances of the original figures. Edit an item’s text or change dates, tags, or other meta attributes, and those changes are instantly reflected back to the original figures.</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Smart Collections</em>, Curio 25’s Search shelf has been completely overhauled to support this powerful query language. And the query language itself, also used by Curio’s instant <em>Quick Find</em> feature, has been greatly extended with even more functionality to help you find exactly what you’re looking for.</p>

<p><a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Curio</a>, first introduced almost 20 years ago, is the most advanced notebook application for note-taking, brainstorming, and research. It provides all the tools and functionality you need to be more productive and get stuff done.</p>

<p>New traditional license purchasers can save 20% using the code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code>. <a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Visit zengobi.com to learn more today!</a></p>
