<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/03/m2646-header-rb.7462.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>
<p>I finally got a significant <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> update out. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlight==</code> rendering, and a BYO JavaScript setup I think (some) users will like.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2021/04/marked2icon.png" /></p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s become so popular, but I&rsquo;ve received a lot of requests for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlight==</code> rendering. So I&rsquo;ve added it as an option. I also added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~deletion~~</code> rendering, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~underline~</code> as an additional option. I had to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~underline~</code> function separately as it conflicts with MultiMarkdown&rsquo;s subscript syntax. But you can find all of these options under Settings-&gt;Processor. There&rsquo;s even an option to convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlights==</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~deletions~~</code> to CriticMarkup, which allows for a nicer display in Marked.</p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ve had requests for <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid diagramming</a> for a long time. I&rsquo;ve had fewer requests for including arbitrary JavaScript in the preview, but I figured if I was going to start adding JS libraries, I might as well make it as flexible as possible.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/03/additionalscripts.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you look under Settings-&gt;Style, you&rsquo;ll find an <strong>Additional Scripts</strong> button. This will open a panel where you can control what JS is loaded in every preview (<a href="https://marked2app.com/help/Embedding_Scripts.html">docs</a>). Mermaid has its own checkbox, and if I add additional library support, checkboxes will be added here. Below that is a 3-pane field where you can add JavaScript from local files, CDN urls, or embed raw text.</p>

<p>Note that when adding libraries, you&rsquo;re responsible for making them update. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Marked.hooks</code> API allows you to hook a render function into the update call, so every time the preview updates (which is not a full refresh), you can trigger whatever rendering needs to happen. See <a href="https://marked2app.com/help/Embedding_Scripts.html#hooks">the docs</a> for details on that.</p>

<p>There are a <a href="https://marked2app.com/help/changelog.html#version2.6.451068">few other fixes</a>. I published a second update this morning (<a href="https://marked2app.com/help/changelog.html#version2.6.461071">v2.6.46</a>) that improves multi-line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlight==</code> rendering, and finally allows you to customize the reading speed for Reading Time calculations. That&rsquo;s available right now for direct (Paddle) customers and in review for Setapp and MAS customers.</p>

<title>Soundtrack fun</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16969703/soundtrack-fun</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16969703/soundtrack-fun</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/soundtrack-header-rb.7455.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>My weekend project was to integrate Songlink info with my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/soundtrack">Soundtrack</a> project. I think it went smashingly.</p>

<p>My Soundtrack page does not get a lot of traffic. That&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s really just a playground for me. I think some of the features of it are really cool, personally, but more than anything, it&rsquo;s a place to play with music service APIs and front end web design.</p>

<p>When I found <a href="https://song.link">Songlink</a>, I was thrilled to have a way to share music without worrying about what services the intended audience preferred. It made links for everything for everybody. When I was informed they also had an <a href="https://linktree.notion.site/API-d0ebe08a5e304a55928405eb682f6741">API</a>, I immediately decided I should find a way to integrate it into Soundtrack.</p>

<h3 id="faved-tracks">Faved Tracks</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was replace the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/soundtrack/#lovedtracks">Faved Tracks</a> page with Song.link embeds.</p>

<figure class="animated_vid_frame shadow" style="padding-bottom: 57.69%;" tabindex="0" title="">
              <video class="lazy" loop="" poster="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/favedtracks-demo.jpg">
                <source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/favedtracks-demo.webm" type="video/webm" />
                <source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/favedtracks-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              </video>
            </figure>

<p>Previously that page had used Apple Music embeds to offer track previews and purchase links. With song.link embeds, I get a YouTube video of the full track, as well as streaming and purchase links for every available service. Perfect. The page loads slowly, as it&rsquo;s booting up 30+ iframes all at once, but it works.</p>

<h3 id="recent-plays">Recent Plays</h3>

<p>For the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/soundtrack/#recenttracks">Recent Plays</a> page, I wanted to do something a little more elegant. I added a small reveal icon to each card on that page, so that when you click a track title in the card (or anywhere other than the meter on the side or the preview/play button at the top), it opens up a side panel with the video and streaming links.</p>

<figure class="animated_vid_frame shadow" style="padding-bottom: 54.00%;" tabindex="0" title="">
              <video class="lazy" loop="" poster="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/recentplays.jpg">
                <source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/recentplays.webm" type="video/webm" />
                <source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/recentplays.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              </video>
            </figure>

<p>I initially just used the medium size embed from Song.link, but I didn&rsquo;t love embedding iframes that embedded iframes (YouTube) and wanted to take it a step further. So I made my own popup that contains the YouTube video embed, plus streaming links for what I consider the most common services. This meant I had complete control over styling, and didn&rsquo;t have to deal with rate limits on Songlink by rapidly loading multiple iframes.</p>

<p>The YouTube videos are lazy loaded, only initiated when the panel is open and removed from the DOM when it&rsquo;s closed. The cursor changes while loading, and ovrerall it&rsquo;s a pretty pleasing interface (to me).</p>

<h3 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h3>

<p>Next, I wanted to push my luck and integrate genius.com lyrics. If you click the genius (yellow) icon in one of these popouts, it will overlay the YouTube video with the song lyrics.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/lyrics.jpg" /></p>

<p>Genius has an API, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually give you the lyrics. You have to use an embed for that. So what I&rsquo;m doing is using the API to get the page link for the lyrics, then scraping that page for the actual lyric content and serving that up from my data file.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h3>

<p>Speaking of the data file, if you&rsquo;re curious how all of this works, it&rsquo;s all running off of a launchd job that parses the various inputs and gathers data every 15 minutes. It uses Spotify and Last.fm APIs to get lists of my top artists, top tracks, recent plays, and favorited tracks, then uses a combination of Last.fm, Spotify, Apple Music/iTunes, and now Songlink and Genius to gather information for each track/artist. It stores all of this in a JSON file which is then used by <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">mustache</a> templates rendered when the page loads. No API calls are made from the Soundtrack page, it&rsquo;s all done in the background.</p>

<p>From a production standpoint, Soundtrack is pretty fragile. Depending on so many external APIs is bound to cause issues, as any change in the API or service outage will break the page. I&rsquo;ve made it as resilient as I can, but it operates at the whim of the service providers. But it works for now!</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/soundtrack">Soundtrack</a> page to play. If, perchance, you have any use for the code, just let me know, I&rsquo;m happy to share.</p>

  <dd>While nothing has ever lived up to an old Mac app called Fluid for me, there are a few good options for creating Single Site Browsers (Mac apps dedicated to a single web service) these days. Flotato is the fastest and lightest weight one I&rsquo;ve seen, while still offering niceties like automatic mobile view and dock badges. It can create a new app from a service like Hulu or Facebook almost instantly, and the browsers it runs are lightweight. Plus it has the automatic benefit of siloing your use of a service from your other browser activities.</dd>

<title>Readwise to DEVONthink update</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16959046/readwise-devonthink-update</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16959046/readwise-devonthink-update</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/readwise_devonthink_update-rb.7447.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>This morning I pushed a pretty large update to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/0a14fcd621526f1ab2ac6fa027df0dea">Readwise to DEVONthink script</a> I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2025/02/08/readwise-highlights-to-devonthink/">published yesterday</a>. It adds some important features, so if you&rsquo;ve already downloaded the script, you might want to update.</p>

<p>The previous version worked fine, but there were a couple of things it needed to do better.</p>

<p>First, it was failing to find existing notes if the note title contained punctuation. This is fixed, so adding highlights and notes to existing documents won&rsquo;t create duplicates. It&rsquo;s still creating duplicate annotations and I haven&rsquo;t figured out why yet, but that may be fixed in a future release.</p>

<p>Second, I didn&rsquo;t like that it was highlighting entire paragraphs when the Readwise highlight was only a portion. I originally set it up that way because it was tricky to match the text when it contained Markdown markup like emphasis and links, as the Readwise highlight wouldn&rsquo;t have that in it, so matching it was difficult and it ran the risk of overwriting or breaking existing syntax. I think I have this solved, and it should always be able to highlight specific text in a paragraph without breaking anything. (If you reset the date file and run the script again, it will update all of your highlights with the more specific versions automatically.)</p>

<p>Highlights are also now sorted by their position in the document when adding them to annotations. Previously it was sorted by date added, so the document order of highlights in the annotations was out of whack.</p>

<p>Lastly, I added some output options. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--quiet</code> to silence all output. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--debug</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--verbose</code> to output a little more information about each bookmark saved. If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--verbose</code> and an AppleScript command fails, it will actually show you the code it tried to run, which is tremendously helpful for debugging.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got it at a point where I can stop fiddling now. Check out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/0a14fcd621526f1ab2ac6fa027df0dea">updated script</a> and let me know if you have any issues.</p>

<title>Readwise highlights to DEVONthink</title>

<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16958687/readwise-highlights-to-devonthink</guid>

<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/02/readwise_devonthink-rb.7447.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p><a href="https://readwise.io/" title="Readwise">Readwise</a> is an awesome power-user tool for reading web articles, newsletters, and even e-books. <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink</a> is an amazing tool for building connected knowledge bases. Today I&rsquo;m releasing a script that saves Readwise highlights to DEVONthink as annotated Markdown files, bringing the two together. It&rsquo;s pretty handy.</p>

<p>I started trying out Readwise shortly after I started really getting into DEVONthink. DEVONthink <em>can</em> function as a Read Later type of tool, but I found Readwise Reader and associated browser extensions to be a lot more pleasurable for the actual act of reading. I weighed the options for a while, and then decided to go ahead and start paying for Readwise. But I was doing all of this highlighting as I was reading, which is really great for comprehension and retention, but those articles and highlights weren&rsquo;t accessible from my larger knowledge base in DEVONthink.</p>

<h3 id="what-it-does">What it does</h3>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/c27bb8cc0f717bcd34ec708d0bf68c7b">This script</a> bridges the gap. It&rsquo;s designed to run at intervals, finding new highlights as you create them, and imports highlighted documents as Markdown files if the document is a web page. If it&rsquo;s something else, like a forwarded email or a PDF/E-book, it will just create a bookmark linking to the Reader URL. The Markdown file/bookmark is then annotated with a list of the highlights and all of their associated notes and tags, as well as the Readwise document summary and any document notes/tags. The annotations are stored as both Finder comments and as separate annotation files.</p>

<p>If the document is saved as Markdown, the script also highlights paragraphs containing Readwise highlights. It does this using CriticMarkup (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{==.*==}</code>), which shows up as highlighted in both the Markdown editor and in the preview. It can only highlight by paragraph (not by sentence), which is fine for me because I typically just highlight by hitting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code> in Reader to highlight the current paragraph. The attached annotations show just the highlighted text, so more intricate highlights aren&rsquo;t lost in this process. This highlighting makes it really easy to jump to pertinent portions of the text from the Document-&gt;Annotations inspector.</p>

<p>The Readwise API can return new highlights added to a document that already had highlights in it. This script handles this by merging new highlights into the annotations and updating the existing highlights in the Markdown. It can&rsquo;t handle deletions of existing highlights via the API (yet), but will merge new and changed highlights.</p>

<p>The other minor caveat is that Readwise allows highlighting of images, but the script doesn&rsquo;t highlight images in the text. However, the annotations will contain the image in Markdown, which will display in the annotations viewer.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h3>

<p>This script is written in Ruby, so you&rsquo;ll need Ruby installed to run it. If your system doesn&rsquo;t have Ruby (I believe it&rsquo;s still installed by default, for now), you&rsquo;ll need to install a copy using the Xcode Command Line tools, or with Homebrew, asdf, mise, rvm, rbenv&hellip; there are lots of options. I recommend running at least version 3.0.</p>

<p>To use the script you&rsquo;ll need your Readwise API token. To get the token, log into your Readwise account and then go to <a href="https://readwise.io/access_token">https://readwise.io/access_token</a>. Copy the token from that page and hang on to it for a second.</p>

<p>Next, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/c27bb8cc0f717bcd34ec708d0bf68c7b">download the gist</a> and save it to your drive as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readwise_to_devonthink.rb</code>. It can be saved anywhere, as long as you know the path to it. Open it in your favorite text editor and paste the API key from above into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> hash near the top of the script. In that hash you can also configure the database and group to save to, if you don&rsquo;t want to use the global inbox.</p>

<p>Next, make the script executable with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x /path/to/readwise_to_devonthink.rb</code>. You can now run it once to get all existing highlights. Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/path/to/readwise_to_devonthink.rb</code> and it will ping the API and get all highlights from the beginning of your history. The date of the most recent run is stored in  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/devonthink/readwise_last_update</code>. Future runs will only get new highlights since the date stored there. If you want to rerun it from the beginning for any reason, just delete that file.</p>

<p>Lastly, you&rsquo;ll want this to run at intervals. macOS provides a perfect tool for this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">launchd</code>. Setting up a job with launchd is a little complex, and I&rsquo;ll probably write a how-to eventually, but for now trust me when I say that using <a href="https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/" title="The launchd GUI">LaunchControl</a> makes it so much easier than editing PLIST files. If you really want to do this by hand, <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/use-launchd-run-scripts-on-schedule-macos/">here&rsquo;s a good article</a>. If this is the only launchd job you ever plan to set up, LaunchControl is probably not worth the price, but if you foresee ever needing to run custom jobs in the background or want a detailed look at what apps are doing so, it&rsquo;s worth every penny.</p>

<h3 id="have-fun">Have fun</h3>

<p>I know there&rsquo;s probably a pretty small sliver of my readers who use both Readwise and DEVONthink, but hopefully this helps someone out. I built it for my own needs, obviously, but I made it as portable as possible so others might benefit. Enjoy!</p>

<title>Archive linkding bookmarks to DEVONthink</title>

<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16952450/archive-linkding-bookmarks-to-devonthink</guid>

<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/10/bookmark-header-rb.7446.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/10/31/archive-linkding-bookmarks-to-local-markdown/">posted a script</a> I was using to archive my <a href="https://linkding.link/">linkding</a> bookmarks to Markdown files in <a href="https://nvultra.com/" title="nvUltra-Searchable, portable, MultiMarkdown notes">nvUltra</a>. I&rsquo;ve since started digging into <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink</a> and have <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/9743ce02964a7e39c34c42054c11cfa5" title="linkding to DEVONthink script">updated the script</a> to archive my bookmarks there.</p>

<p>I still use <a href="https://bookmarks.scoffb.in" title="Brett's Bookmarks">my bookmarks</a> with nvUltra by indexing a notebook in DEVONthink and saving the bookmarks there. Most of my bookmarks are still archived as Markdown, so that allows me to view and edit content in either place. (The same could be done with Obsidian.) Web archives and PDFs also display in nvUltra, so I have both options available for viewing. But in DEVONthink I can link the archived bookmarks to other documents, tag and classify them, and annotate all types with highlights and notes.</p>

<p>The script I&rsquo;m running allows me to tag bookmarks to be archived, just like the original script. The script runs at regular intervals using launchd on my always-on Mac Studio. It&rsquo;s a self-contained script that requires just Ruby and one gem (HTTParty) to run. It&rsquo;s best run as a user agent, but it should work if run as a global agent (as root) as well. Installation and configuration are documented in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/9743ce02964a7e39c34c42054c11cfa5#file-readme-md" title="README for the script">README</a> (and in the script comments).</p>

<p>Aside from having my bookmarks readily available in DEVONthink, this also allows me to make use of DEVONthink&rsquo;s clipper, making conversion to webloc bookmarks, PDF files, or web archives easy, in addition to Markdown notes.</p>

<p>I set the script up to use Marky 2.0 as the Markdownifier, but have been getting sketchy results for some reason, so I currently have it configured to use the version of Marky 1.0 that DEVONthink has built in. I hope to fix this soon. Switching is just a configuration option, so watch here for an update when I get it smoothed out.</p>

<p>The script allows configuring a single tag that will cause a bookmark to be ingested, and there are other tags to specify what type of bookmark is saved: PDF, web archive, webloc (bookmark), or Markdown. The way I run it, any bookmark tagged with the main <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.archive</code> tag gets saved as Markdown unless I also specify one of the other types. If you don&rsquo;t set a default type, you can save as both Markdown <em>and</em> another type.</p>

<p>See the Gist link below to download the script. The configuration options are all in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> variable at the top, and are well-commented. Define your server information, the DEVONthink database and group to use, and the tags you want to use for the various types.</p>

<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/" title="The launchd GUI">LaunchControl from soma-zone</a> for editing launchd jobs. It makes setting all of the options easy, and loading/unloading a job is just a button click away.</p>

</ul>

<p>Please let me know if you use it and have any issues. I know this is a very specific use case and maybe one or two people will ever need it. No matter, I needed it for my own use, but if it helps anyone else, I&rsquo;m always happy to share.</p>

<p>I knew I had some form of <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6004-dysautonomia" title="What It Is, Symptoms, Types &amp; Treatment">dysautonomia</a>, but I was having trouble finding a doctor who was curious enough about my various symptoms<sup id="fnref:symptoms"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:symptoms" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to give me a diagnosis. I finally found what I needed through the <a href="https://www.eds.clinic/" title="The EDS Clinic:Medical Care for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome"><abbr title="Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome">EDS</abbr> Clinic</a>, with a hat tip to <a href="https://terra.incognita.net/@blackqueeriroh">Bryan Guffey</a> for pointing me there.</p>

<p>It was a Telehealth appointment, which allowed for visual tests like mobility and basic orthostatic tests, but lacked blood work, so some of these are initial diagnoses that could change. Just that morning I&rsquo;d had an orthostatic pulse and blood pressure reading at Gundersen Health, so I was armed with the numbers and observations from that. I came out of it with diagnoses of:</p>

<ul class="abbr_desc">
  <li><a href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-hsd/" title="The Ehlers Danlos Society"><abbr title="Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder">HSD</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" title="Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis &amp; Treatment"><abbr title="Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome">POTS</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome" title="Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)"><abbr title="Mast Cell Activation Syndrome">MCAS</abbr></a></li>
  <li>And likely <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988" title="Thoracic outlet syndrome-Symptoms and causes"><abbr title="Thoracic Outlet Syndrome">TOS</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these are surprises &mdash; I had done extensive research on autonomic disorders and knew where my symptoms fit (and where they didn&rsquo;t). Thanks to a growing database in <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink</a> and some research help from my partner, I had a cross-referenced list of symptoms and possible correlations ready to go. I&rsquo;ve found that with rare diseases &mdash; especially ones that don&rsquo;t show up in blood work or show up with results that are individually explicable in other ways &mdash; it&rsquo;s best to show up armed with as much information as possible. Thankfully, because the clinic specialized in <abbr title="Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome">EDS</abbr>, the physician was ready to listen and fully versed in the various disorders and syndromes comprising dysautonomia.</p>

<p>So now that I have some diagnoses, I&rsquo;ve started treatment, and things have improved markedly. Some interventions &mdash; like increasing water and salt intake and applying abdominal compression &mdash; are easy and have already improved my <abbr title="Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome">POTS</abbr> symptoms, which include dizziness and syncope (passing out) when standing up. I&rsquo;m more functional than I have been in six months. And I&rsquo;ve started medications, both over the counter and prescription, which have started to help symptoms like constant dizziness (even when seated or prone) and skin burning. I&rsquo;m still dizzy as I write this, and some of these interventions might take a while, but things are getting better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow up with some blood work, and I need to find <abbr title="Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome">EDS</abbr>-aware physical therapists, but I have referrals and orders for all of that. It&rsquo;s such a relief to be making forward progress. I&rsquo;ve communicated with people with similar diagnoses who&rsquo;ve told me that it took two or more years (in one case six) to get a diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve joked that my current title is:</p>

<p>Brett Terpstra <em><abbr title="Minneapolis College of Art and Design">BFA</abbr>, <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, <abbr title="Substance Use Disorder">SUD</abbr>, <abbr title="Bipolar Disorder">BD</abbr>, <abbr title="Religious Trauma Syndrome">RTS</abbr>, <abbr title="Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder">CPTSD</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder">HSD</abbr>, <abbr title="Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome">POTS</abbr>, <abbr title="Mast Cell Activation Syndrome">MCAS</abbr>, <abbr title="Thoracic Outlet Syndrome">TOS</abbr></em></p>

<p>Which is quite a Scrabble board, but it looks more impressive than just having an &ldquo;MD&rdquo; after your name, right? I only went to college for four years, but I&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of letters since then (and none of them great).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so thankful for my community &mdash; from readers here to Facebook to Mastodon to real life friends and family &mdash; and the leg up I got by sharing openly and receiving information from them. I know that I might be risking some privacy by sharing too much, but the benefits have been great thus far. I never would have gotten to this point without help. I have further to go, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve cleared some major hurdles at this point.</p>

<p>And seriously, I need to write about <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink</a> and how useful it was in all of this. I&rsquo;m hesitant because I have so much more to learn about it, but the more I talk about it and hear from other people, the more I realize that so many users are in the same boat: using it for specific reasons but feeling like they&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of its capabilities. So I&rsquo;ll probably write about the subset of features I&rsquo;ve used for this specific research, rather than write <a href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/devonthink-3/">a whole book about it</a><sup id="fnref:tc"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:tc" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Stay tuned.</p>

<title>Marky gets DEVONthink integration</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16941987/marky-gets-devonthink-integration</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16941987/marky-gets-devonthink-integration</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/marky-devonthink-rb.7433.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been obsessively into DEVONthink lately. Once I&rsquo;ve truly explored it, I&rsquo;ll write more about that, but in the meantime I wanted to share a handy integration for those already using it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very aware that DEVONthink has a great clipper. Whether you&rsquo;re using bookmarklets, browser plugins, or the Sorter directly, it can grab a web page and convert it to Markdown, Web Archive, Formatted Note&hellip; whatever you want to do with it. The only problem I&rsquo;ve run into is that the built-in Markdownifier lacks some of the things I built into <a href="https://markdownrules.com">Marky the Markdownifier</a><sup id="fnref:previous"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:previous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So I added my own clipper.</p>

<p>DEVONthink has a very useful URL handler, which you can explore by looking at the source code for <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/support/download/extras">their bookmarklets</a> (or by dissecting a browser plugin, but why bother?). It has options for clipping, creating Markdown and formatted notes, generating web archives, and more. For my purposes, I just wanted to create Markdown notes, but use Marky instead of the built in Markdown conversion tool. It took me about 10 minutes to build DEVONthink clipping into Marky itself.</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/cliptodevonthink-800.jpg" /></p>
              
              <figcaption>Clip to DEVONthink in Marky</figcaption>
            

<p>After Markdownifying a page with Marky, either from the main page or a custom bookmarklet (which Marky can generate for you), you&rsquo;ll get a preview window with a &ldquo;Clip to&hellip;&rdquo; option. Clicking that will give you a list of options, now including DEVONthink.</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/permissions.jpg" /></p>
              
              <figcaption>Permissions in Firefox</figcaption>
            

<p>The first time you use it, you&rsquo;ll probably have to grant permission for Marky to open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x-devonthink</code> urls. I know there&rsquo;s some magic in Chrome to grant permissions to all url handlers, but I&rsquo;ve never found the same setting in Firefox, my browser of choice. But once you grant permission once, you should be good to go in the future.</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/inbox-800.jpg" /></p>
              
              <figcaption>DEVONthink inbox</figcaption>
            

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve Markdownified a page and clipped to DEVONthink, it will show up in your Global Inbox, ready to be classified. If you Markdownify to MultiMarkdown or GFM, tags in the original web page will be automatically applied to the new document (if you enable that in tag settings). I move most of these into my main nvUltra folder, which is an indexed folder accessible to both DEVONthink and nvUltra. Super handy that way.</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/edit-preview-800.jpg" /></p>
              
              <figcaption>Markdown Preview in DEVONthink</figcaption>
            

<p>The page imports as a regular Markdown document, ready to edit and preview.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to DEVONthink users. I&rsquo;d like to figure out how to clip the Markdown as a Formatted Note next, but my experiments thus far haven&rsquo;t worked. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>

<p>Of course the generated DEVONthink url is available in the API as well. Just set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link</code> format to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">devonthink</code>. See <a href="https://heckyesmarkdown.com/api/#link-formats">the docs</a> for details.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:previous">
      <p>At some point the developers asked me if they could use the source code for Marky v1, which I of course granted. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re using that anymore, though, as their clipping is much better than the original Marky.&nbsp;<a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:previous">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Strikethrough and emojis for mdless</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16939367/strikethrough-and-emojis-for-mdless</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16939367/strikethrough-and-emojis-for-mdless</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/emoji-mdless-rb.7432.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>
<p>I just published a couple of new features to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a> this morning: strikethrough and GitHub emoji support.</p>

<p>You can now use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~text~~</code> formatting, and if your terminal supports strikethrough text, it will be displayed as such. You can control formatting and colors by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deletion</code> to your theme file, which by default is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/default.theme</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">deletion</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">strikethrough red</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added support for GitHub emojis, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:smile:</code> for 😁 and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:umbrella:</code> for ☂️. I can&rsquo;t guarantee full compatibility, but a vast number of emoji are covered. Enough that VS Code choked on the list and I had to open the trusty <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html" title="BBEdit 15">BBEdit</a>, which is an absolute champ at handling large files. Emoji support in mdless is enabled by default and requires no configuration changes.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, but if you use mdless, especially for reading GitHub files, I think you&rsquo;ll appreciate the additions. Just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install mdless</code> to update!</p>

<title>My "remote" web development setup</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16938543/my-remote-web-development-setup</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16938543/my-remote-web-development-setup</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/local-web-dev-header-rb.7430.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>Recent <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//2024/11/28/a-health-update/">changes in my health</a> have made it such that some days I&rsquo;m couch-bound upstairs, while my office (and primary work computer) is in the basement. This has led to some interesting solutions for my daily work.</p>

<p>My day job at Oracle I can mostly do from my couch and my work laptop. The only thing I have to get to my downstairs office for is recording voiceovers for the videos we&rsquo;ve been creating lately. My mornings are typically better for me health-wise, so I write scripts upstairs in the afternoon, and then record in the mornings with my expensive podcasting setup. So that&rsquo;s covered. But <em>especially</em> early in the morning I work on my personal stuff, which involves a lot of web development.</p>

<blockquote class="info">
  <p>For the purposes of this post, &ldquo;remote&rdquo; generally refers to a Mac Studio (Agony) in my basement office, and &ldquo;local&rdquo; refers to whatever laptop I&rsquo;m working on at the time. Most of these solutions work with <em>actual</em> remote machines, but some of them are specific to working on machines on the same network. This should become clear as I go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Websites for projects like <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a>, <a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a>, <a href="https://dimspire.me/">Dimspirations</a>, and my personal blog (this one) are all Jekyll-based and set up on my Studio in my office. Rather than duplicate my setup and cause disparities between copies of my site, I&rsquo;ve set up a &ldquo;remote&rdquo; development setup that I think is worth writing up, if for no other reason than a reference point next time I set up a new machine.</p>

<blockquote class="error">
  <p>None of this is specific to Jekyll, so don&rsquo;t give up reading at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On my couch I have three laptops available. My work laptop, my older Intel MacBook Pro<sup id="fnref:intel"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:intel" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and my M4 MBP. My setup allows me to do web development on any of them without breaking the sites hosted on my Mac Studio. Here&rsquo;s how I keep them all in sync and develop these websites smoothly from the couch.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h3>

<p>First, I have a &ldquo;drafts&rdquo; folders for each site stored in Dropbox. Those folders are symlinked in the Jekyll directory of each site, so I can created drafts for posts locally in each directory (using a Rake task) and they&rsquo;re automatically available on all machines. That works great for a folder full of text files, but is a mess when dealing with Git repositories.</p>

<h3 id="local-git-server">Local Git server</h3>

<p>I run a Git server on my Synology for private repos. All local copies of the websites are clones of Git repositories on that server. This means that if I create things like images, archives, or other non-text assets on my local machine, I can commit and push them to the git server and pull them on remote machines.</p>

<p>I sometimes use an SSH session to go into remote directories and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code>, but I also have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/ebd0a8b53534177996085830a9681611">script called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pullremote</code></a> that takes an SSH alias as an argument. Each machine has an identical directory structure for the websites, so the function just takes the current directory on my local machine and runs an SSH command that runs a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> in the same directory on the remote machine. So once I&rsquo;ve created an asset and want it available on the host, I just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pullremote a</code> from my development machine to pull the repository on Agony (my Studio)<sup id="fnref:names"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:names" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m creating images like screenshots, I use <a href="https://cleanshot.com/" title="CleanShot X for Mac">Cleanshot X</a> to save the screenshot, then I rename it in Finder or Terminal. I have a <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/" title="Simply Useful Software">Hazel</a> task that watches my desktop for images with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%%</code> in their name and a script that responds to naming conventions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">screenshot-name@2x%%r1600hco.png</code>. That processes the image with &ldquo;resize to 1600px&rdquo; (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r1600</code>), &ldquo;create a 1x version&rdquo; (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code> for &ldquo;halve&rdquo;), &ldquo;convert to JPEG&rdquo; (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code>), and &ldquo;optimize all results&rdquo; (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code>). The optimize command runs whatever optimization tool works best for that image type (pngcrush, imageoptim, etc.).</p>

<p>I have all of these tools and their preferences synced between
machines using Dropbox and symlinks.</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/filename-screenshot.jpg" /></p>
              
              <figcaption>File naming in CleanShot</figcaption>
            

<p>Once the assets are created, I drag the resulting images (created by the aforementioned setup, or with a <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch 2, from Flying Meat">Retrobatch</a> droplet which Hazel runs &mdash; based on a Finder tag &mdash; that creates a bunch of image sizes and additional formats like webp) to a <a href="https://aptonic.com/" title="Dropzone 4:Aptonic">Dropzone</a> target for whichever site to which they belong, and that copies the assets to the appropriate local folder and puts an appropriate Liquid tag for that image set or download in my clipboard for use in draft posts/pages. Then I use git and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pullremote a</code> to sync to the main setup.</p>

<h3 id="iterm-and-tmux">iTerm and tmux</h3>

<p><a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="macOS Terminal Replacement">iTerm</a> has a <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-tmux-integration.html" title="iTerm tmux integration">tmux mode</a> that makes working on Agony easy. It&rsquo;s not a fully-functional tmux setup, but it means that I can have a shared tmux configuration that functions with native windows and panes. I can run an alias like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jeka</code> on any machine to open up a tab with multiple panes that are actually shared remote sessions. I use that to do things like spin up a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> command on the main machine and have all of its output and Rake tasks available on whatever machine I&rsquo;m working on, and I can close one machine and open another and the remote session is seamlessly available in native windows with the same session.</p>

<p>Using tmux also means that closing a machine (thus disconnecting the SSH session) doesn&rsquo;t interrupt the remote tasks. Native windows mean I can navigate them just like local windows, switching panes and managing windows with the same keyboard shortcuts as local windows, instead of having to use tmux leader-based commands in one tab and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-]/["><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">]/[</kbd></span> commands in another, and scrolling, copying and shell integration work much more smoothly than in tmux. (My Fish prompt has a bright yellow tag in it that alerts me when the current window is an SSH session and which machine it&rsquo;s connected to so I don&rsquo;t lose track.)</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/iterm-screenshot-800.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h3>

<p>OK, so a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> command runs a Webrick server on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost</code>, so now I&rsquo;ve set up a port 4000 server on Agony that&rsquo;s only available on that machine. So I run reverse forward SSH tunnels on my laptops that tunnel port 4000 and other ports (like the livereload server) from Agony to the local machine. These forwards are easy to set up with <a href="https://www.hejki.org/ssheditor/">SSH Config Editor</a>, and all of my laptops are set up this way. I set them up one time in my SSH config and I don&rsquo;t have to think about it again &mdash; I can point my browser on any machine to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000</code> and get the site being served from Agony.</p>

<h3 id="vs-code-remote-explorer">VS Code Remote Explorer</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code-Code Editing. Redefined">Visual Studio Code</a>, my current editor of choice, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" title="Developing on Remote Machines using SSH and Visual Studio Code">Remote Explorer</a> extension that allows me to tunnel to a remote machine and then edit files as if they were local. So I&rsquo;m tunneled in to Agony, but editing its files as if they were on my local machine. It&rsquo;s brilliant. I&rsquo;m working on Agony&rsquo;s files, previewing my work in my browser, all as if it were local to the machine I&rsquo;m working on. I can load all of VS Code&rsquo;s extensions in the remote session, too, and run commands from the built-in terminal. I love it. (And working with <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" title="Your AI pair programmer">GitHub Copilot</a> in VS Code is a next-level coding experience.)</p>

<p>My Rake deploy task automatically does a git commit with all changes and a message summarizing them, pushing it to the main git server. Then when I pick up development on any other machine, I just have to do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> to get any files I edited remotely.</p>

<h3 id="vim-setups">Vim setups</h3>

<p>Of course there are times I just need to load up Vim on Agony to fix a little spelling error in a page or quickly edit a config file. I use <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot">DotBot</a> to sync all of my config files, including shortcuts and Vim plugins such as Markdown editing tools.</p>

<p>DotBot makes it easy to do the initial symlinking of config directories, then updating setups is just a couple of Git commands away. And vim works great over SSH, so while it&rsquo;s not my main editor, it&rsquo;s a great tool for quick fixes. I mean, if you know a whole bunch of keyboard sequences&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="mamp-stacks-and-local-dns">MAMP stacks and local DNS</h3>

<p>Lastly, there&rsquo;s a remote Apache/Nginx setup. Some functionality on my sites is CGI/Ajax-based, and I have special image handling that relies on Apache .htaccess files, and none of that works with Jekyll&rsquo;s built-in server. I need a full Apache or Nginx server to see those. So I run <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/" title="Downloads">MAMP Pro</a> or the new <a href="https://indigostack.app/">IndigoStack</a> on Agony.</p>

<p>MAMP has a product called <a href="https://www.mamp.info/namo/en/" title="Your local DNS server for macOS">NAMO</a> that runs a local DNS server for you. That could be done with some config file editing, but NAMO makes serving up the hosts configured on Agony to any machine on my network an easy task. I set up a development/staging host like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev.bunch</code> in MAMP, add Agony&rsquo;s local IP as the first DNS server in my System Settings-&gt;Network setup on my laptops, and suddenly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev.bunch</code> works on any machine on my network (including my iPhone/iPad) for testing.</p>

<p>NAMO passes any non-local addresses through whatever fallback DNS servers you configure in it. I use network &ldquo;locations&rdquo; to easily switch between the NAMO setup and my regular DNS settings (which forward through my Synology DNS cache and router VPN setup).</p>


              
              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/namo-screenshot-800.jpg" /></p>
              
              <figcaption>Hosts in NAMO</figcaption>
            

<h3 id="screen-sharing">Screen sharing</h3>

<p>I should mention that Sequoia&rsquo;s High Performance mode for Screen Sharing is the coolest VNC setup I&rsquo;ve ever seen. If you have a remote machine and haven&rsquo;t tried it (and your bandwidth allows), check it out. When I need to do something on Agony that I haven&rsquo;t automated with any of the above, it makes working with the remote machine so, so nice.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s especially handy when I want to reboot my basement machine, but more smoothly than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shutdown -r now</code>. I can load it up, quit apps gracefully, and then run a macOS reboot instead, storing all my open apps and windows and generally doing things more nicely.</p>

<h3 id="actual-remote-work">Actual remote work</h3>

<p>When I want to access all of this while I&rsquo;m on the road (hopefully
I&rsquo;ll eventually be able to do that again), I love <a href="https://tailscale.com/">TailScale</a> for
creating a personal VPN that makes all of my home machines accessible
via IP address. If you haven&rsquo;t tried it, you really should. It&rsquo;s free
and can function using your GitHub account as login.</p>

<h3 id="in-closing">In closing&hellip;</h3>

<p>With this (admittedly somewhat complex) setup, I can edit sites on three different laptops without missing a beat. It&rsquo;s really not that hard to set up once, and from then on all of the changes I make are instantly available on my main desktop machine, and everything is synced between development machines with very little effort while I&rsquo;m working on the couch.</p>

<p>If any of this is of interest to you and I haven&rsquo;t explained it well enough, <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">drop by the forum</a> and I&rsquo;m happy to elaborate!</p>

<h3 id="one-more-thing">One more thing&hellip;</h3>

<p>As a final and mostly unrelated aside, I have a cool setup for my work VPN. Cisco&rsquo;s AnyConnect VPN client makes accessing anything <em>not</em> on the VPN a pain, and it doesn&rsquo;t store passwords, so you have to constantly log in and out of the VPN and paste your password every time.</p>

<p>Instead I run a Docker container on my Mac mini server in the basement that&rsquo;s constantly logged into the VPN &mdash; but only for Oracle sites using an automatic proxy configuration it hosts &mdash; and tunnel a port from my various machines through that container&rsquo;s ports. So I&rsquo;m always on VPN, but also not. It&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>

<title>A StretchLink Shortcut</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Immo Junghärtchen shared a Shortcut for StretchLink.cc on the forum, and I&rsquo;ve modified it slightly for my own needs. Find both below.</p>

<p>The original shortcut can be found <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com/t/introducing-stretchlink-cc/2426/2?u=ttscoff">on the forum</a>, but here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8f5255e7295e4f9a853679b1d4125766">direct link</a>. Thanks to Immo for getting this started.</p>

<p>I created my own version specifically for outputting Markdown links, with a few other modifications. You can download it below. If you need to convert short urls to long urls in Markdown for blogging, forum post, etc., this should save you some time. When you install it, you can optionally set it up to clean tracking info and tidy up those unwieldy Amazon URLs.</p>

<title>Habit Traffic: A Unique Approach to Habit Tracking</title>

<p>Eric Linder, whom I affectionately call my Rabbi<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, has created a habit tracking app with a twist, and it&rsquo;s ready for wider testing.</p>

<p><a class="zoom" href="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/habit-traffic-screenshot-600@2x.7426.webp"></a></p>

<p>He had a need for something that didn&rsquo;t exist, so he built it. He did it in maybe three weeks, using AI to learn how to code it. I&rsquo;m really impressed how fast someone who previously had zero coding experience pulled together an app and got it all the way to a polished beta.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let him explain the app below. If you find it intriguing, get on the TestFlight and help him get across the finish line with an app that the world might need.</p>

<p>From Eric (Rabbi) Linder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I’d love if you would help to beta test my new app, &ldquo;Habit Traffic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a class="btn--big btn--last btn--alt" href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/vnGwD7wh">Join the TestFlight</a></p>

  <p>Hi! I’m Eric, and I’ve bought, downloaded and used dozens of habit tracking apps on my iPhone in the last year.</p>

  <p>Many of them are beautiful and have great design, but none of them have the one feature that I most need:  Which of my habits actually need my attention today. Which ones can wait?</p>

  <p>I wanted an app that would cut through the clutter and show me ONLY the habits that need my focus right now, based on the goals that I set. </p>

  <p>Depending on the goals that you set per habit, each habit is given a status:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🟢 Green: You&rsquo;re on track (relax!)</li>
    <li>🟡 Yellow: Heads up for tomorrow</li>
    <li>🔴 Red: Action required today</li>
    <li>⚫ Black: Goal missed, reset incoming</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I have tried to incorporate many power user features into this app including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Flexible sorting options</li>
    <li>User-created color-coded categories</li>
    <li>Automatically resets and recalculates habit progress based on user-defined goals</li>
    <li>Statistics (streaks, total durations, etc)</li>
    <li>Implementation for &ldquo;negative&rdquo; habits (example, you want to eat sugary snacks at MOST three times a week)</li>
    <li>One I&rsquo;m particularly proud of: what I call the &ldquo;interactive traffic light&rdquo; in the top left of the app, where at a glance you can look at all your habits that are green, yellow, or red</li>
    <li>Export/import data</li>
    <li>Notifications</li>
    <li>Advanced category categorization, with ability to collapse/expand categories and reorder</li>
    <li>&hellip; and more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>During the past few weeks, this app has been in a very closed beta, but I think that it&rsquo;s ready to be released more widely. Huge thanks to my friend Brett Terpstra for cheerleading this app, and for being such a wonderful friend in the Apple/Mac community!</p>

  <p>You are of course more than welcome to <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/vnGwD7wh">join the TestFlight</a> send feedback through the TestFlight app, but I would really love if you <a href="https://discord.gg/UMyVU4ZVkx">joined the app&rsquo;s Discord</a> and left feedback/ideas/criticisms there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So please help with testing. If you&rsquo;re not already on TestFlight, it&rsquo;s free and the links above will take you the install page. You&rsquo;ll get first access to this useful app, and can start easily tracking your habits right away!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I often need to strip emoji from strings to prevent them from messing up other handling. I&rsquo;ve been compiling regular expressions and I think I finally have all the bases covered.</p>

<p>This example is in Ruby, but the regular expressions are easy to adapt to any language:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already ported this to Swift and Python, and <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/strip_emoji">put together a
repo</a> intended to keep these as living documents that are
updated to keep up with new emoji. If you&rsquo;re into this kind of thing,
please make pull requests as you discover new edge cases. You can
create PRs against the [README.md][], which contains the main regular
expression, or against any of the languages you use. And if you port
this to any other language, please add a routine to <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/strip_emoji">the repo</a>!</p>

<title>Brett's Favorites 2024: Behind The Scenes</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16931942/bretts-favorites-2024-behind-the-scenes</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16931942/bretts-favorites-2024-behind-the-scenes</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/bretts-favorites-2024-rb.jpg" /></p>

<p>So I used a lot of tools and automations to put this year&rsquo;s lists together. Here&rsquo;s a behind-the-scenes look at them.</p>

<p>Putting lists like these together is so much easier with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a> and my new <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/12/18/auto-generate-setapp-affiliate-links/" title="Auto-generate Setapp Affiliate Links">Setapp Affiliate link Shortcut</a>. I can just make a list of my favorite apps with the app name surrounded by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[app name](!s)</code>, adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(!s +additional search terms)</code> if the name is vague. When the list is complete, just run SearchLink on the whole file and have all the links added.</p>

<p>I included a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(Setapp)</code> marker after the ones that were on Setapp, then wrote a little script that found those markers, grabbed the app name proceeding them, and ran it through the Setapp Affiliate shortcut<sup id="fnref:bitly"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:bitly" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Usually all of the little Setapp icons just link to the Setapp main page, but with the new tools this year, each one links to the Setapp landing page for that specific app.</p>

<p>For the hardware list, SearchLink was able to help by grabbing links from my Firefox history, which had the landing pages stored. I also leveraged my Linkding plugin to grab pages I knew I&rsquo;d bookmarked. It takes a little memory to know what to look for where, but it&rsquo;s easy to adjust the search and try again.</p>

<p>I got about 90% accuracy on all of the links, and cleaning them up was easy. The report that SearchLink provides, which includes app titles where possible, made it easy to verify, and any mysteries were easily solved using my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions/#checkurls" title="Brett's PopClip Extensions">URL Preview PopClip extension</a> (also available <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/url-preview/">as an Action/Service</a>), which lets you pop up a quick preview without switching to your browser.</p>

<p>I could easily have added app icons to the Mac and iOS posts with a little scripting and my various icon grabber scripts that can pull icons from local apps or use the iTunes API to get icons from the App Stores. That looked to busy, though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing all of the editing in <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a>, but that uses the same editing engine as <a href="https://multimarkdown.com/" title="MultiMarkdown Composer">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>, so even if you&rsquo;re not on the beta<sup id="fnref:beta"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:beta" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, you can still have all that power. Moving sections around, selecting sentences with a keystroke, full autocompletion of all Markdown syntax (including reference links), file transclusion, all of the things.</p>

<p>Add to that list <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/">all of my custom keybindings</a>, which make things like adding SearchLink syntax easy. And selecting paragraphs and sentences with quick keystrokes means running SearchLink on a per-paragraph basis is all a few keystrokes away. I can even bookmark a spot in the text with <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-1"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">1</kbd></span>, scroll to another part and copy or cut text, then jump back to the original location with <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-2"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">2</kbd></span>. Even if you never use the vast majority of the key bindings I have in the example file, there are bound to be a few that you find useful.</p>

<p>And then I have my Jekyll plugins, such as my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2021/06/22/a-jekyll-plugin-for-documenting-mac-keyboard-shortcuts/">keyboard shortcuts</a>, and my Keyboard Maestro <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2021/09/01/keyboard-maestro-markdown-linking/">plugin for cross-linking</a>, and blogging is so easy with my current setup.</p>

<p>I shudder to think about doing lists like these without these tools. If you blog, you should check them out.</p>

<title>Use iTerm to handle x-man-page URLs</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16931584/use-iterm-to-handle-x-man-page-urls</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16931584/use-iterm-to-handle-x-man-page-urls</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/iterm-man-page-rb.7420.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>It started when I was playing with LaunchBar search templates. I tried the man page search and it opened a nice window in Terminal. But I didn&rsquo;t want to open Terminal when iTerm was already running.</p>

<p>My initial search said it wasn&rsquo;t possible, but in fact it&rsquo;s really easy. I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/jspiewak/77f2fb3c321b396efe72">this gist</a>, which solved the problem.</p>

<p>iTerm profiles can be set to handle URL handlers, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x-man-page</code>, which is what the search template uses. If you create a new profile (call it &ldquo;Man Page&rdquo;) and under General, change &ldquo;Login Shell&rdquo; to &ldquo;Command&rdquo; and paste this in:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>bash -c "echo $$HOST$$ | sed -E 's/(.*)\/(.*)/\1 \2/' | xargs man"</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then at the bottom of the General pane, locate &ldquo;URL Schemes,&rdquo; and choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x-man-page</code> from the dropdown. It will ask you if you want to make iTerm the default handler &mdash; click Yes (that&rsquo;s the point of this).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the minimum you have to do. I went ahead and customized the color scheme, set the window to 80 columns, and added a little transparency and blur under Window settings. Under Session settings, I made sure that it was set to close when the command terminated, and disabled the warning about early termination, which was just annoying when I mistyped command and needed to try again.</p>


              <p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/01/iterm-man-page-themes.jpg" /></p>
              <figcaption>iTerm man page themes</figcaption>
            

<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com//downloads/iterm-man-page-themes.zip">Here are the color schemes I made</a>, both light and dark. I&rsquo;m generally a &ldquo;dark&rdquo; guy in Terminal, but I kind of liked the light theme that Terminal used for man pages. I made it less yellow, and added contrasting colors for bold and underline text, which looks great when viewing man pages. Customize to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty cool trick, hopefully it helps those who didn&rsquo;t already know about it. Once you have it set up, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x-man-page://[COMMAND]</code> anywhere you like, including aliasing it in your shell or creating a function. In Fish it would be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>function nman --description 'Open man pages in a new terminal window'
    open "x-man-page://"$argv
end</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<title>Brett's Favorites 2024: Late Additions</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16931468/bretts-favorites-2024-late-additions</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16931468/bretts-favorites-2024-late-additions</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/bretts-favorites-2024-rb.jpg" /></p>

<p>Happy New Year! I managed to get the bulk of the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/series/bretts-yearly-top-apps-lists/">Best of 2024 series</a> out before the midnight deadline. Nice job, Brett. But here are a few late additions that I missed, and ones I&rsquo;m looking forward to using more of in 2025.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink Pro</a></dt>
  <dd>OK, this one snuck up on me. I&rsquo;ve been buying licenses for it for years, but never let it become a central part of my workflow.</dd>
  <dd>Last week I moved a bunch of research into DEVONthink to see what would happen. I&rsquo;d tried (many times) in the past and it overwhelmed me with organization options. Something finally clicked for me and I realized exactly how good it is. I think I&rsquo;m going to be using it a lot more moving forward.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://redsweater.com/blackink/" title="Solve Crossword Puzzles With Style.">Black Ink</a></dt>
  <dd>When you need a break and you&rsquo;re still feeling intellectual, crosswords are a perfect respite. Black Ink makes solving them so much nicer than doing them in, say, the NYT app, and way more fun than doing it in pencil (or ink, you daredevil).</dd>
  <dd>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Daniel Jalkut, the developer, too. He makes a few great apps (<a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/" title="Powerful web publishing from your Mac.">MarsEdit</a>, <a href="https://redsweater.com/fastscripts/" title="FastScripts 3">FastScripts</a>, <a href="https://redsweater.com/">and more</a>), plus he&rsquo;s always willing to take a minute to help out other developers, even ones with stupid questions (me).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://blaze.today/" title="Text Blaze:Snippets and Templates for Chrome">TextBlaze</a></dt>
  <dd>I still use <a href="https://textexpander.com" title="TextExpander for Windows, Mac, iPhone, and iPad">TextExpander</a>, but have really gotten into TextBlaze as an alternative. Great possibilities for automation. It&rsquo;s especially useful if you work in Chrome or Chromium browsers (I don&rsquo;t), but the Mac app is perfectly usable and very handy.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://icemenubar.app/" title="Ice-Menu Bar Manager">Ice</a></dt>
  <dd><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" title="Take control of your Menu bar">Bartender</a> switched owners and they pulled some shenanigans that upset the Mac community last year. I think they&rsquo;ve smoothed out that snafu, and for menu bar management I still love Bartender on my laptop, but I&rsquo;ve been using Ice on my Studio and it&rsquo;s pretty darn good.</dd>
  <dd>Bartender&rsquo;s &ldquo;groups&rdquo; feature is pretty killer, though, and I have my menu bar set up so that I don&rsquo;t need the extra Bartender bar, I just expand groups. I have about 40 menu bar apps running and I can fit them all in my menu bar to the right of the notch on my MacBook Pro, which is pretty impressive. I&rsquo;m fairly certain Ice can&rsquo;t do that yet, but it&rsquo;s still being developed.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://hookproductivity.com/" title="Links beat searching">Hookmark</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;ve been using Hookmark for a while and have gotten into the habit of hooking files, websites, and emails together as I work. DEVONthink is replacing some of that functionality for me, but you can use Hookmark even <em>inside</em> of DEVONthink, and you can easily hook DEVONthink documents to other places you might not need to import into your database.</dd>
  <dd>Hookmark requires a bit of a mode shift as you get used to it, but it&rsquo;s a smart way to approach navigating your documents, research, brainstorming, and daily work.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://sipapp.io/" title="Sip Color for Mac">Sip</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Sip all the time, from web design to app design. I can grab palettes I like from <a href="https://coolors.co/" title="Coolors-The super fast color palettes generator!">Coolors</a> and import them into Sip, where I can adjust and edit them. I have a dock on the side of my screen with the palettes I&rsquo;m using most frequently, and I can get a code (whether it&rsquo;s hex, rgb, or any form of NSColor) with a hover and a click. It&rsquo;s great. It even has a very complete <a href="https://sip-documentation.super.site/url-schemes">URL handle</a> for automation.</dd>
  <dd>Bonus mentions of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pastel/id413897608?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Pastel">Pastel</a>, another great tool for managing palettes, and <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/pinwheel/">Pinwheel</a>, a great app for color conversion.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://wallaroo.app/" title="Wallaroo - Wallpapers Just For You!">Wallaroo</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;m a patron of IconFactory and get all of their wallpapers included. Wallaroo is the perfect app for browsing them and applying them to your Mac desktop and iOS screns. Such great work. Plenty of free wallpapers included without a subscription.</dd>
  <dd>Also see <a href="https://wallwiz.com/" title="Mac Wallpapers and Backgrounds App">Wallpaper Wizard</a> from MacPaw (and obviously <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZW2qUf">on Setapp</a>
).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://cindori.com/">Backdrop</a></dt>
  <dd>Speaking of wallpaper, Backdrop is in beta and is a great way to apply animated/video wallpapers. It has a really cool selection, and only costs $10/year. I&rsquo;m partial to the dark, cyberpunk cityscapes, but there&rsquo;s a wide selection.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.weightedhug.com/">Weighted Hug</a></dt>
  <dd>A friend of mine just launched this project this year. They&rsquo;re currently making each one by hand, and the quality is amazing. If you have any kind of anxiety, putting one of these on will change the world. My breathing slows, my skin stops crawling, the noise of the world becomes bearable. I can&rsquo;t guarantee that everyone&rsquo;s experience will be the same as mine, but I would be remiss not to mention this as a top pick for 2024.</dd>
</dl>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s all the usual suspects and daily drivers I&rsquo;ve used for years and mentioned frequently. Well, less frequently these days because I feel like you&rsquo;ve heard about them from me plenty. But just to list a few:</p>

  <dd>I still consider SearchLink &ndash; out of a hundred projects &ndash; the most useful thing I&rsquo;ve made, for my own purposes at least. Sure, it&rsquo;s only helpful to bloggers and podcasters, really, but I use it almost daily.</dd>
  <dd>I built a few new plugins this year, some for personal use, <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins/">some for sharing</a>. And you can <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/08/10/add-searchlink-plugins-using-any-programming-language/" title="Add SearchLink plugins using any programming language">add SearchLink plugins using any programming language</a> now, too.</dd>

  <dd>Rather than add complex predicate handling to <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> for handling multiple custom processors, I built a tool that allows you to configure your custom processors using YAML, allowing easy creation of &ldquo;tracks&rdquo; to apply different tools to different types of projects. In addition to running custom processors and scripts, it also has a bunch of built in filters for doing common tasks without any scripting.</dd>
  <dd>I have a new release of Marked almost ready that adds the ability to inject your own JavaScript into the preview. Local scripts, CDN-hosted scripts, and embedded scripts are all possible, making things like adding Mermaid or updating the DOM a simple process requiring no Custom Preprocessors or anything.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/curlyq/" title="CurlyQ">CurlyQ</a></dt>
  <dd>I made this one to scratch my own itch, but it&rsquo;s a pretty complete tool for web scraping. I added the screenshot capability last, but now it&rsquo;s the feature I use most often.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a></dt>
  <dd>Bunch, my Mac app for automating with plain text, didn&rsquo;t actually get a lot of development this year, aside from bug fixes. But it&rsquo;s still an app near and dear to my heart and I plan to keep it going as long as I can.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">NA</a></dt>
  <dd>NA (next action, not Narcotics Anonymous) is my tool for working with TaskPaper formatted todo lists on a per-project basis. This year I added a lot of functionality based on <em>other</em> people&rsquo;s use cases, and came to adopt some of the creative ideas for my own use. It&rsquo;s really nice when you put something out that sparks other people&rsquo;s interest enough to request changes 😊.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2022/11/30/bretts-favorites-2022-personal-projects/" title="Brett's Favorites 2022-Personal Projects">Howzit</a></dt>
  <dd>I did a lot with Howzit, my task-running, note-taking, project-saving tool. I use a Howzit file in every single one of my projects, allowing me to keep track of all of the steps for things like building, testing, and deploying, and be able to run them in any project with predictable commands. This year saw improvements to templating, named variables, and more.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a></dt>
  <dd>I built this one because I&rsquo;ve tried so many code snippet managers and none of them fit all of my needs. Storing my snippets in plain text and being able to tag them, search them, output syntax highlighted code, and copy straight to clipboard, all from the command line, makes this a frequently-used project for me, too.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">Journal</a></dt>
  <dd>Another one I built just for me, but it got some traction among like-minded people. I needed to track a bunch of data for my therapist and my doctor, and being able to generate prompts and output structured data meant I could do all of my journaling from the command line and output final results in any format I could need. I send spreadsheets to my therapist, PDFs to my doctor, and all of it is backed up in Day One automatically.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/shortly/" title="Shortly, custom url shortener">Shortly</a></dt>
  <dd>I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/03/16/build-a-custom-url-shortener/">built this one</a> for the <a href="https://dimspire.me/" title="Home-Dimspire.me-Dimspirations for Daily Life">Dimspirations</a> site so I could create fun <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dim.moi</code> urls for individual Dimspirations. It&rsquo;s just a simple URL shortener, but it&rsquo;s customizable and you can add it to any domain. Custom short urls for free (well, for the cost of a domain and basic hosting, but you already have that, right?).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://markdownrules.com">Marky</a></dt>
  <dd>I completely <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/09/29/marky-2-dot-0/">rewrote Marky the Markdownifier</a> this year. If you need to convert web pages to Markdown in any flavor, Marky has you covered. And most importantly it has a decent API, so it&rsquo;s easy to incorporate &ldquo;markdownification&rdquo; into a workflow. I use it with my Linkding scripts to create Markdown archives of my bookmarks that show up in nvUltra.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/binbundle">Binbundle</a></dt>
  <dd>I got a new MacBook Pro this year and had to rebuild my system. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew bundle</code> makes a lot of it easy, but I use a <em>lot</em> of Ruby gems and their associated tools, so I made Binbundle to replicate Brew functionality, but for Ruby gems. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else has needed this one, but it was super handy in setting up my new machine.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing">Doing</a></dt>
  <dd>I love Doing, my plain text tracker for &ldquo;what was I doing?&rdquo; entries. It&rsquo;s gotten way out of control, with more features than I can possibly remember. I have to consult <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/doing/wiki">the wiki</a> (and extensive built-in help, and command-line completion) pretty frequently. But it does its job really well. I even added it to my current Fish prompt (starship), so it displays the currently-timed task, reminding me what I was focusing on (and also to stop timers before I forget about them). If you want any help adding something similar to your prompt, I&rsquo;m happy to help.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/soundtrack/">Soundtrack</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;m always tweaking my Soundtrack project, which makes a public display of my somewhat embarrassing music-listening habits. It&rsquo;s really an HTML, JavaScript, and CSS playground for me, and I&rsquo;m pretty proud of all of it&rsquo;s little features. A few people have expressed interest in setting up their own versions, but nobody has ever followed through. If you have any interest, contact me, I&rsquo;m happy to share the code!</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a></dt>
  <dd>I know, I say this every year. For what, like 5 years now? But nvUltra development has continued this year, mostly thanks to Fletcher, and we&rsquo;re just a couple steps away from a Mac App Store launch, and hopefully a direct version and Setapp release as well. The beta is very complete and essentially public at this point, but you still need to <a href="https://nvultra.com">email me through the website link</a> to get added.</dd>
  <dd>I&rsquo;ve said this before, but a lot of the release schedule depends on Fletcher, who is a parent and an ER doctor with limited time. And I have a full-time job with Oracle. nvUltra is awesome and I use it <em>all day, every day,</em> but the release schedule has been <em>extremely</em> slow due in no small part to the fact that it&rsquo;s not a full-time job for either of us.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I worked on other projects, but this is what the combination of Timing and Doing is telling me. I wrote some cool stuff for my day job, but I&rsquo;m already in trouble for putting some of it in my own GitHub as public repos, so I won&rsquo;t poke the bear by sharing more. Hopefully you&rsquo;re finding at least some of my projects useful. If you are, drop by <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">the forum</a> and <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com/t/do-you-actually-use-any-of-my-tools-which-one-s/1932">let me know what you&rsquo;re using</a> and what you&rsquo;d like to see me put development time into.</p>

<p>This collection is more than just computer hardware. It&rsquo;s physical things I&rsquo;ve loved this year. Anything that isn&rsquo;t software.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://store.177milkstreet.com/collections/knives/products/milk-street-nakiri">Milk Street Nakari</a></dt>
  <dd>My new favorite kitchen knife. They&rsquo;re fairly affordable and I love the form factor of the Nakiri, and given I eat mostly vegetables, it&rsquo;s the most useful knife in my collection.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://yuzukeycaps.com/">YUZU Keycaps</a></dt>
  <dd>So I started the year by buying a <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/02/17/a-cerakey-ceramic-keycap-review/" title="A Cerakey ceramic keycap review">whole bunch of ceramic keycaps</a> from <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/" title="Ceramic Keycaps &amp; Keyboards">Cerakey</a> for my <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="ultimatehackingkeyboard.com">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a>. I liked them, but then I found YUZU, which offers an <a href="https://yuzukeycaps.com/keyboards/uhk">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard layout</a>. The hardest part of owning a UHK is the fact that so many of its keys are non-standard sizes and customization takes way too much effort. YUZU&rsquo;s layout made it <em>so</em> easy to get a full keyset in one go, rather than ordering a bunch of one-off custom keys. Perfect, and now I have my full &ldquo;clickiness&rdquo; back.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch" title="Buy 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro">M4 MacBook Pro</a></dt>
  <dd>If you&rsquo;re reading my blog, I probably don&rsquo;t have to tell you a lot about MacBooks. But this M4 chip is awesome. My last MBP was the last of the Intel processors and kind of sluggish at this point (and the battery was shot). I still need it for development, but this is <em>amazing</em> in comparison.</dd>
  <dd>Recent health changes have made it harder to get down to my office, where I have my M1 Mac Studio (which I love but will gladly update if and when a newer processor is available). So I&rsquo;m mostly working upstairs, and this M4 MBP is my daily driver most days. I have zero complaints, other than missing my Ultimate Hacking Keyboard.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y4J9GR8/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="Synology 5bay Expansion DX517 Diskless">Synology 5-bay Expansion Unit</a></dt>
  <dd>I finally filled up my Synology, between backing up 5 computers, storing movies and TV shows, and general archiving. So I bought the expansion and loaded it up with another 40TB of storage. I think I can work with that.</dd>
  <dd>NAS-approved hard drives get expensive, and I keep a couple extra around in case I&rsquo;m ever unemployed and drives start failing, with me unable to shell out a few hundred for a replacement. Thanks to the expansion I now have two hot-swap drives and two brand new, uninstalled drives, so I should be good for a while. I&rsquo;ve only had one drive fail since I got the Synology, but I know there&rsquo;s a life expectancy.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFJM6QBL/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="CHENSIVE Conduction Headphones Bluetooth Waterproof">CHENSIVE Bone Conduction Headphones</a></dt>
  <dd>I have different-sized ear canals. My right ear just won&rsquo;t hold an earbud no matter what size cup I put on it. Thus, no earbuds work for me. I wish I could use AirPods, but no. I love my <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-ace" title="Wireless Over Ear Headphones with Noise Cancellation">Sonos Ace</a> over-ear headphones (like, a lot), but for watching TV quietly or listening to music when I&rsquo;m walking the dog, they&rsquo;re not ideal. I need to hear what&rsquo;s going on around me, and they&rsquo;re bulky. So I got into bone conduction headphones. They never make my ears sore, the sound quality is pretty astounding, they leave your ears completely open, and they don&rsquo;t bleed sound for others to hear. They&rsquo;re awesome for me. In addition to the CHENSIVE ones, I also use a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDCGKZBT/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="SHOKZ New OpenRun Pro Comfortable">SHOKZ OpenRun Pro</a>, which are waterproof and sound amazing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FKH9ZDC/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="Klipsch R 100SW 10 Subwoofer">Klipsch R-100SW 10&rdquo; Subwoofer</a></dt>
  <dd>When I&rsquo;m listening to music at home, I love bass (sometimes). I know audiophiles frown on messing with the engineer&rsquo;s EQ, but a decent portion of the music I enjoy is just more fun with throbbing bass. So I got a subwoofer. To make it work with my setup, I also needed a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VD16YJW/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="PreSonus MicroStation BT Controller Connectivity">PreSonus MicroStation BT 2.1 Monitor Controller</a>, which adds a sub out and Bluetooth connection.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/41Jfv5P">Govee Lights</a></dt>
  <dd>I used to think I just wanted all of my lights as bright as they could be. But it turned out that what I was actually missing was color. Govee lights were the most affordable way to add remote-controllable lights all over my office, from hexagonal artwork on the wall behind me to standing lamps on the sides, to light bars behind my monitor&hellip; I love the options I get. I can press a button on a remote (or using Alexa, limited functionality with Siri) and turn my whole office warm or cool, and I have settings like &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo; that adds red and yellow lighting with a slow, comforting &ldquo;flicker,&rdquo; or one I call &ldquo;womb&rdquo; that lights up my office in a soothing pink glow. I love that one when I&rsquo;m doing IFS work with my therapist over Zoom&hellip;</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1692461874/modern-hardwood-sofa-arm-table" title="etsy.com">Modern Hardwood Sofa Arm Table</a></dt>
  <dd>Given the amount of work I&rsquo;m doing from the couch these days, I bought a <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/steelside-bismarck-72-full-grain-genuine-italian-leather-sofa-w004217688.html">new one</a>. It&rsquo;s really nice, but the arms of it do <em>not</em> hold a laptop safely. I found this arm table on Etsy and I love it. The maker worked with me to get the exact right size, and now the sofa arm is perfect for holding my laptop, my dinner, my movie-watching snacks, remote controls, etc. I do have a side table, but this is way more convenient and within reach.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/244278077/raccoon-watercolor-painting-print-by?ref=yr_purchases">Raccoon Watercolor Painting Print</a></dt>
  <dd>Anyone who knows me well, knows I <em>love</em> raccoons. My partner knitted me one that I admittedly sleep with. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6791350/" title="Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> makes me sob (and I&rsquo;ve watched it five times now). So I buy a lot of raccoon-themed stuff. This painting hangs in my living room and I adore it. I also found a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1085672446/wheelthrown-raccoon-mug-cup">new favorite coffee mug</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1778213163/death-hawk-moth-archival-art-print">Death Hawk Moth Archival Art Print</a></dt>
  <dd>One of my dearest friends from college married an amazing artist. She mostly does pen/ink/watercolor paintings of mushrooms, minerals, and insects, and they&rsquo;re amazing. I have several of her pieces, and this one is my latest acquisition. It&rsquo;s so cool. I got the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1790240712/death-hawk-moth-sticker">sticker version</a> for my new laptop, too.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1482490625/manta-ray-keycap-yellow-manta-ray-sa">Manta Ray Keycap</a></dt>
  <dd>In the process of building my ceramic keycap set out, I had to fill in some of the UHK&rsquo;s non-standard sizes. I found these Manta Ray keycaps and used them for the whole mod-key row. At the 1u size they glow nicely with backlighting. (At wider sizes they&rsquo;re opaque. Still pretty, but they don&rsquo;t glow.) I have a few extra laying around now that I have the YUZU set, so if you&rsquo;d like some, contact me.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1435465554/ready-to-use-lily58-pro-split-keyboard">Ready-To-Use Lily58 Pro Split Keyboard</a></dt>
  <dd>Sure, I was into keycaps this year, but I also wanted to try some new keyboards. I built a Sophie but didn&rsquo;t love it. After the time dump that was, I wasn&rsquo;t anxious to build another one unless I was sure I was going to like it. I found this pre-assembled Lily58 on Etsy for a decent price, and picked it up. I&rsquo;m still programming it, and I have no intention of ditching my UHK, but it was a nice way to try out other options.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Well, that was kind of a weird collection. I know you didn&rsquo;t ask what I spent money on this year, but I told you anyway. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

<title>Brett's Favorites 2024: iOS</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16928623/bretts-favorites-2024-ios</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16928623/bretts-favorites-2024-ios</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/bretts-favorites-2024-rb.jpg" /></p>

<p>Like I said in my last post, I do way more on my Mac than I&rsquo;ll ever do on iOS, so this will be significantly shorter. iOS is mostly for playing games, Messages, social stuff, and consuming media. But here are a few standouts.</p>

<h3 id="ios-apps">iOS apps</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Drafts">Drafts</a></dt>
  <dd>When I wake up in the middle of the night with an idea, Drafts is what I open. Or when someone tells me about a movie or TV show I need to see, it goes into Drafts. Easy to search and tag, and the easiest way to just enter text with no hassle.</dd>
  <dd>I still use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1writer-markdown-text-editor/id680469088?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="1Writer - Markdown Text Editor">1Writer</a> as my nvUltra/nvALT companion.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-monsters-ate-my-condo/id6446234652?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Super Monsters Ate My Condo+">Super Monsters Ate My Condo</a></dt>
  <dd>I play NYT word games, Threes, and Super Monsters Ate My Condo. That&rsquo;s really all. I download games from Arcade now and then, but <abbr title="Super Monsters Ate My Condo">SMAMC</abbr> (which is on Arcade, by the way), is hands down the most addictive, thrilling, visually exciting game I know. I&rsquo;m pretty good. I usually make the top 20 leaderboard for the week. But it never gets boring for me.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Ivory for Mastodon by Tapbots">Ivory</a></dt>
  <dd>I mentioned this under Mac apps, but it&rsquo;s also my favorite Mastodon client on iOS.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Paprika Recipe Manager 3">Paprika</a></dt>
  <dd>Nothing new or updated here, just a stalwart solution for collecting and notating recipes with all the features you need. Easily download recipes from the web and accurately convert them to Paprika recipes, create shopping lists from a recipe, share them with your family, automatically scale recipes, set multiple timers&hellip; an all-in-one companion for the kitchen.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heart-analyzer-pulse-tracker/id1006420410?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Heart Analyzer: Pulse Tracker">HeartWatch</a></dt>
  <dd>Get a great overview of your Apple Watch heart readings and activity rings as a companion to the Health app.</dd>
  <dd>I also love <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111">AutoSleep</a> from the same developer, which is great for tracking my sleep habits. The two are available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/sleep-wake-be-healthy/id1706431256">as a bundle</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ssh-files-secure-shellfish/id1336634154?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="SSH Files – Secure ShellFish">ShellFish</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a great SSH client for iOS. I was recently in the hospital and had time to play with doing remote work via my iPhone, and this client was my favorite. There are several good apps in this area out there, and I&rsquo;m not going to do a side-by-side here, but I love this one.</dd>
  <dd>Of course, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prompt-3/id1594420480?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Prompt 3">Prompt 3</a> from Panic is always a good option (at least on iOS). Version 3 came out this year, if I recall the timeline correctly. I could be off.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/s3-files-storage/id6447647340?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="S3 Files &amp; Storage">S3 Files &amp; Storage</a></dt>
  <dd>I use this on both Mac and iOS for mounting Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Oracle Cloud, and other cloud services, making them available in Finder and in Files on iOS.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-me-gluten-free/id431006818?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Find Me Gluten Free">Find Me Gluten Free</a></dt>
  <dd>I have an allergy to gluten, which limits my dining possibilities. But I <em>love</em> eating out, especially when traveling, and this app is a community-sourced collection/review site for all gluten free dining options wherever you are. I&rsquo;ve never been anywhere it didn&rsquo;t point me in the right direction.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vhs-synth-80s-synthwave/id1615208667?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="VHS Synth - 80s Synthwave">VHS Synth</a></dt>
  <dd>AudioKit offers a ton of really fun synth apps, including <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/synth/">Synth One</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/king-of-digital-hybrid-synth/id6467825289">King Digital</a>, and <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/synesthesia/">Synesthesia AR</a> (which I haven&rsquo;t been able to try yet). They offer <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/audiokit/">an SDK</a> that allows anyone with a bit of coding experience to build great audio apps.</dd>
  <dd>I buy almost all of the one-off synths at introductory prices as soon as they come out, and they often seem to disappear from the App Store after a while. VHS Synth was one of my favorites this year, but if you enjoy software synths, check out their whole lineup.</dd>
</dl>

<p>That&rsquo;s a wrap for this one. I use a myriad of other mostly unremarkable apps, and some that are no longer available but still kicking for me. I love camera apps, for example, but the built in Camera app on my phone really leaves very little to be desired. Everything else is kinda gimmicky, in my experience.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for at least two more installments of this year&rsquo;s favorites!</p>

<title>Brett's Favorites 2024: macOS</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16928096/bretts-favorites-2024-macos</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16928096/bretts-favorites-2024-macos</guid>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/bretts-favorites-2024-rb.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here we go again with my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/series/bretts-yearly-top-apps-lists/">yearly roundup</a> of my favorite stuff. I&rsquo;m going to do this year in a few parts. This one will be all Mac apps, and it will the longest because Mac apps are my favorite.</p>

<h3 id="best-new-and-updated-macos-apps">Best new and updated macOS apps</h3>

<p>In no particular order, here are some of my favorite new apps, as well as some that received notable updates. As always, this list is not exhaustive, and I welcome you to add your own top picks in the comments. I may even publish an addendum if I made any glaring omissions.</p>

<p>Many (most?) of these apps are available on Setapp, which now has over 230 apps. It&rsquo;s definitely worth the monthly price, and I highly recommend <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44?utm_medium=vendor_program&amp;utm_source=Brett+Terpstra&amp;utm_content=link">checking it out</a> if you&rsquo;re not already a subscriber. It also gives your favorite developers a source of recurring income without forcing them into their own subscription model, which leads to requiring users to have a hundred subscriptions just to use the apps they love.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.hejki.org/ssheditor/">SSH Config Editor</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3DIS6HG">SSH Config Editor</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a really cool way to interface with your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/config</code> file. It makes it easy to add advanced options, set up tunnels/forwarding, and quickly open connections.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apphousekitchen.com/">AlDente Pro</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3PdcXp8">AlDente Pro</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;m loving this one. It&rsquo;s a battery manager for Mac laptops that allows you to set a max charge level and keep your Mac there. It&rsquo;s supposed to be hard on a battery to be at 100% all the time, so if your laptop is plugged in more often than not, this will keep that from happening. It also offers a lot of info on your battery, can get actual hardware charge levels, and even controls the light on your magsafe cord to show you when you&rsquo;ve reached <em>your</em> fully charged level, when it&rsquo;s charging, and when it&rsquo;s discharging.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.inyourface.app/" title="In Your Face-The meeting reminder app">In Your Face</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3Dtz0Fr">In Your Facee</a></dt>
  <dd>I miss meetings. A lot. I look at the calendar and think, &ldquo;oh I have 15 minutes, I could finish up this code before the meeting,&rdquo; then get so absorbed that I miss the little notification from Calendar and show up 20 minutes late, if at all. This app takes over your whole screen with customizable alerts that make it absolutely impossible to miss a meeting. A life (and job) saver.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://soulver.app/" title="Soulver 3-Notepad Calculator App for Mac, iPad &amp; iPhone">Soulver</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/4fBLWX8">Soulver</a></dt>
  <dd>Not a new app by any means, but I&rsquo;ve really gotten into using it this year. I&rsquo;m not great at math. I have to break down complex problems to solve them, and with Soulver I can kind of write out my thoughts in sentence form and get the answers I need from them. Perfect.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://boltai.com/" title="BoltAI • Native, high-performance AI app for Mac">BoltAI</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3Dyr7ig">BoltAI</a></dt>
  <dd>A friend asked me about which AI app they should get, given the over saturation of the market at this point. This one stands out above the herd, allowing for easy chats with any available LLM, hotkey access with Quick Action style input, temporary and permanent chats, and more. It does it all in an easy to grok way.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://binarynights.com/" title="Forklift 4">Forklift</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/4gwNnHG">Forklift</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Finder a lot, but when I&rsquo;m deep into organizing or want to work with a cloud/FTP server, Forklift is where I turn. Frequently updated and rock solid.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/" title="iStat Menus">iStat Menus</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/4gtJfZf">iStat Menus</a></dt>
  <dd>iStat Menus saw a major update this year, and it&rsquo;s awesome. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;unified&rdquo; menu bar item that can combine whatever information you like into one menu bar item. I have that and the weather icon in my menu bar, with system/network stats tucked away in my Bartender secondary menu bar. It&rsquo;s elegant and useful.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://signal.org/" title="Signal &gt;&gt; Home">Signal</a></dt>
  <dd>However you feel about the state of the world, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly important to protect privacy where you can. Apple Messages is great for end-to-end encrypted chat with other Apple users, but for universal  encrypted chat, Signal is the way to go. Also available on iOS, obviously.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://typefaceapp.com/" title="Typeface App-Font Manager for Mac">Typeface</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/4gtdmQh">Typeface</a></dt>
  <dd>I have a ton of fonts, mostly from my days as a graphic designer, and partly because I just like hoarding them. But finding the right font out of 5GB of fonts is rough, and the big players have not only become unaffordable, they&rsquo;ve also become unreliable. Typeface simplifies the process elegantly, and offers all the typographical niceties you need.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://cleanshot.com/" title="CleanShot X for Mac">CleanShot X</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/4gtdxep">CleanShot X</a></dt>
  <dd>CleanShot X gets my vote for overall best app of the year. It does its job (screenshots) so perfectly that you might not even realize how powerful it is. The floating windows at the edge of your screen, ready to drag, annotate, save, send to the cloud, or discard are perfect, plus you get screen recording, OCR, and beautiful screenshot editing all in one package.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.bzgapps.com/unite">Unite</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3ZSJLIV">Unite</a></dt>
  <dd>I miss Fluid, but Unite fills most of that gap for me. I can make SSBs (Single Site Browsers) for all the web apps and services that don&rsquo;t have a native Mac app. I use it for Bluesky and Threads, and have apps for my Linkding and Marky, just to name a few.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.arqbackup.com/" title="Cloud backup software for Mac and Windows">Arq</a></dt>
  <dd>I can never have too many backups. I use Time Machine, <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00dszk">Backblaze</a>, Synology Drive, and Arq. Arq is versatile, with backups to B2, S3, SFTP, and more, and its restore functionality and version history is top notch.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://choosy.app/" title="Choosy:A smarter default browser for macOS">Choosy</a></dt>
  <dd>Choosy has been around forever, and there are a few apps trying to contend for its spot. It makes it easy to use multiple browsers, set up rules for when to use which browser, and pops up a handy menu when there&rsquo;s not a rule and you have multiple browsers open (or no browsers open, it&rsquo;s totally configurable). It&rsquo;s still my top choice for this functionality.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch 2, from Flying Meat">Retrobatch</a></dt>
  <dd>If you do batch image processing, or repeat the same steps on images regularly, Retrobatch offers a node-based interface for building workflows to automate image processing. I use it to turn templated images into things like Dimspirations (and all of the social and wallpaper sizes from one image) and all of the header images on my blog posts. And it can make droplets (which I call from LaunchBar), so it&rsquo;s perfect for long-term automation tasks.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" title="Kaleidoscope App">Kaleidoscope</a></dt>
  <dd>I swear by Kaleidoscope for all of my &ldquo;diffing&rdquo; needs. Whether I&rsquo;m comparing versions of a file, multiple directories, Git merge conflicts, Git history, or anything I need to see the changes in (even images), Kaleidoscope offers a very Mac-assed experience with smooth edges. It&rsquo;s not cheap, and you&rsquo;ll know if you need it. And if you do, you&rsquo;ll love it.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.git-tower.com/" title="The most powerful Git client for Mac and Windows">Tower</a></dt>
  <dd>Tower is in the same category as Kaleidoscope. Not cheap, but if you need it, it&rsquo;s the best there is. Working with Git has never been easier, including deep GitHub integration and support for everything from Git-flow to stacked brach workflows. It even has a Cmd-Z undo feature that does things that would normally require digging into reflogs and history fiddling that could take a normal user 20 minutes (or an hour&hellip;).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://kindavim.app/" title="kindaVim">kindaVim</a></dt>
  <dd>This is so cool. If you use Vim, and you&rsquo;d like your keyboard-fu to extend elsewhere, kindaVim brings it to your whole Mac. Want to go to the top of a file list in Finder? Just hit the shortcut to enable kindaVim, hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gg</code>, then hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> to return to &ldquo;insert mode.&rdquo; And bring your Vim shortcuts to everything from text editors to form fields. Works in browsers, in Terminals, in Finder, almost everywhere.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://superkey.app/" title="Superkey">SuperKey</a></dt>
  <dd>This utility does a few things, and it does them well. You can use it to create a Hyper key from your Caps Lock, but it can create a Meh key (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Option-Shift"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd></span>) for you as well. And its killer feature is screen search. You just pop up its search window, type some text that appears anywhere on your screen, hit Enter, and it focuses and clicks that button, checkbox, text, etc. Very handy.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/" title="Ivory for iOS">Ivory</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;ve completely moved away from Twitter. I didn&rsquo;t delete my account because I still do some customer support there, but I use Mastodon for all of my social media-ing. And Ivory stepped in to fill the Tweetbot-sized hold in the Mastodon experience (it&rsquo;s also from Tapbots). Multi-column layout, multi-account, beautiful interface, and seamless features for dealing with the Fediverse.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=6385" title="Announcing Moom 4, the next-generation window manager">Moom 4</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;ve used Moom for years for window management. Version 4 was almost shocking in its breadth of new features. I can&rsquo;t imagine the competition catching up any time soon.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.corecode.io/macupdater/" title="keep all your apps up-to-date effortlessly">MacUpdater</a></dt>
  <dd>It&rsquo;s important to keep your apps up-to-date, and it&rsquo;s easy to let apps you don&rsquo;t use every day slip through the cracks. MacUpdater fixes that for you, constantly scanning for new updates and making it a one-click process to update everything at once.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.mindnode.com/" title="MindNode">MindNode</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3VTSvNO">MindNode</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;m still using iThoughts X for as long as I can, but I&rsquo;m really impressed with how far MindNode has come. I have to admit, it&rsquo;s the best looking mind map software out there. I&rsquo;m working my way over to it.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://macitbetter.com/" title="BetterZip 5-MacItBetter">BetterZip</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/41KSYWs">BetterZip</a></dt>
  <dd>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t drop the money on this if it weren&rsquo;t on Setapp, but it is and I love it. For archiving, unarchiving, previewing zip contents, and pretty much anything having to do with compressed archives, it&rsquo;s perfect. And it has a Quick Look plugin that makes previewing the contents of an archive as easy as hitting your space bar.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://appmakes.io/paletro" title="Command Palette in any applications">Paletro</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/3VT0CdD">Paletro</a></dt>
  <dd>This is so cool, and I use it daily. You just hit a customizable shortcut in any app, and all of that app&rsquo;s menu items are a typeahead search away, including Services and hidden menu items. I have it set to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Shift-Command-P"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">P</kbd></span>, which is also what I use for quick open and action palettes in every app that supports them, so the keyboard shortcut is second nature to me.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://timingapp.com/?lang=en" title="Timing Automatic Mac Time Tracker">Timing</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://bit.ly/49TplnM">Timing</a></dt>
  <dd>I continue to use Timing constantly. I don&rsquo;t do a great job of tracking what I&rsquo;m working on, starting timers (or adding Doing entries), or remembering where I spent my time. If I had billable hours, I&rsquo;d probably love it even more. But the developer has added a bunch of new features in 2024, including a vertical timeline and AI-assisted classification of your time blocks. It&rsquo;s perfect for a scatterbrain like me.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.zengobi.com/" title="Zengobi Curio-Note Taking, Mind Mapping, Brainstorming">Curio</a></dt>
  <dd>Curio might be the Mac app that gets the most frequent major version updates I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And every time the new features are exciting. It&rsquo;s a brainstorming, researching, project managing powerhouse. And the developer has continued adding great Markdown features that make my plain-text-loving side very, very happy.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://tailscale.com/" title="Tailscale·Best VPN Service for Secure Networks">Tailscale</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44?utm_medium=vendor_program&amp;utm_source=Brett+Terpstra&amp;utm_content=link">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>A personal VPN that makes accessing all of your machines from anywhere easy. Your Macs, your iOS devices, your Synology/NAS, Windows machines, everything. No need to deal with updating dynamic DNS, just run Tailscale on everything and have instant access whether you&rsquo;re at the coffee shop or halfway around the world. And you can run it all off a GitHub login, so setup can take just minutes.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleeve-for-spotify-music/id1606145041?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Sleeve for Spotify, Music">Sleeve</a></dt>
  <dd>Sleeve is my current pick for a &ldquo;now playing&rdquo; interface. With customizable desktop artwork and  playback controls, it&rsquo;s simple but pretty. It works with Spotify and Apple Music, with Last.fm integration.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code-Code Editing. Redefined">Visual Studio Code</a></dt>
  <dd>It took me a long time to come around to VS Code. But now that I&rsquo;m into it, I&rsquo;m really into it. And using it with Copilot or Llama is an out-of-body cool coding experience.</dd>
</dl>

<p><a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/" title="Full Featured Photo Editor for the Mac">Acorn</a>
I should also mention that Acorn saw some <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/12/acorn-8-brings-subject-selection-live-text-data-merge-more/">awesome updates</a> this year. I mostly use Affinity Photo, but I keep an eye on Acorn because it&rsquo;s pretty brilliant.</p>

<h3 id="web-apps">Web apps</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and tack a few web apps onto this post, as there&rsquo;s only a couple of them and I run these in <a href="https://bit.ly/3ZSJLIV">Unite</a> SSBs anyway, so they&rsquo;re kind of Mac apps for me.</p>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding" title="sissbruecker/linkding:Self-hosted bookmark manager that ...">Linkding</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;ve completely replace Pinboard with linkding now. All of my scripts that used to interface with Pinboard now use my self-hosted <a href="https://linkding.link/api/" title="API - linkding">linkding API</a>, and I have Shortcuts and extensions for every browser to make bookmarking as easy, if not easier, than it was with Pinboard. I&rsquo;m even on a secret beta of a dedicated iOS app with a share sheet for bookmarking from anywhere. Hopefully that sees the light of day and I can share it with you.</dd>

<title>Scripting when you're away: beengone 2.0</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16927338/scripting-when-youre-away-beengone-2-dot-0</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16927338/scripting-when-youre-away-beengone-2-dot-0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/beengone-header-rb.7412.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>I took a few hours to revive an old project. It had stopped working on modern machines, and despite its limited usefulness, it fit a need for me and I want to get an updated version out there.</p>

<p>Sure, it took way longer to fix and deploy than it was worth, and I
ended up going another direction in the script I was writing at the
time, but it was fun and just enough challenge to keep my mind busy on my holiday break.</p>

<p>This is a revival of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2013/02/10/beengone-a-script-friendly-way-to-check-computer-idle-time/">beengone 1.0</a>, a simple little tool that just tells you how long your computer has been idle (no input from
keyboard or mouse). Version 2.0 not only gets that working again, it
adds some command line flags that are designed to make scripting
easier.</p>

<p>For example, it has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--minimum XXX</code> flag that can take an integer or interval string like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3h30m</code> and will provide an exit code based on whether that threshold has been met. That&rsquo;s perfect for looping in a background script and only moving on when it returns a 0 exit code. But wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--wait XXX</code> flag that takes the same input, but
blocks the script until the threshold is met, bypassing the need for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while true</code> loops when you don&rsquo;t actually need them (when nothing else needs to happen on each iteration).</p>

<p>It can even simulate a mouse click with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--input</code>, which will reset the timer, and possibly wake up your machine. I haven&rsquo;t tested that much.</p>

<p>There are a few simple example scripts on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/beengone">beengone project page</a>. If you do anything cool with this, please let me know. My assumption is that nobody will have an immediate need for it, so surprise me. Maybe someday the need will arise and you&rsquo;ll stumble back upon it in a web search.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beengone</code> works while your screensaver is on if it&rsquo;s running in the
background, either in a background shell script or as a launchd
process. It should also work when your machine is sleeping, or upon wake with launchd, but almost definitely not in hibernate mode. But if you want a script that, say, stops a timer when you&rsquo;re not using your Mac for five minutes, this is your tool.</p>

<p>Side note, the hardest part of these binary command line utilities is distribution. You can&rsquo;t sign a lone binary outside of an app bundle, so you have to put it in a PKG file. And you have to sign the binary with a development ID within the PKG, but you also have to sign the PKG with an installer ID. Two different certificates to install a 94k binary, and without it the tool just won&rsquo;t run. It&rsquo;s a pain, but I also get exactly how risky downloading unknown binary files from the internet is, so I appreciate the level of security. Hopefully I got it right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve automated the process at this point, so I can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r deploy</code> and the tool will be tested, built, packaged, signed, notarized, and uploaded to a tagged release on GitHub, which is what the download link then points to. The project page and GitHub README get updated as part of the build process, too.</p>

<p>Anyway, please use it if you need it, and tip your server if you think they deserve it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the link to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/beengone">project page</a> again, and you can see all the source code <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/beengone">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Happy holidays, happy Solstice, happy Hanukah, merry Christmas, happy Kwanza, and you know, whatever you&rsquo;re into. Enjoy the cozy evenings in the darkest time of year. (In the norther hemisphere, anyway. I don&rsquo;t know what Australians get up to this time of year.)</p>

<title>Introducing StretchLink.cc</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16925839/introducing-stretchlink-dot-cc</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16925839/introducing-stretchlink-dot-cc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/stretchlink-header-rb.7411.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>I made something in the process of making something else. I didn&rsquo;t finish the something else, but figured I&rsquo;d share the thing&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/stretchlinkicon.jpg" /></p>
<p>I got an itch to revive StretchLink, my little menu bar app that expanded shortened links as you copied them, so you had a full URL when you pasted. It was great for seeing where a link would take you before following it. Given the state of the internet, that seemed useful.</p>

<p>I have the code to resolve links internally, but I like the flexibility of an API. The original StretchLink relied on an API that has since died, so I decided to just write my own. It&rsquo;s not complicated.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s <a href="https://stretchlink.cc">stretchlink.cc</a>. A simple little API that takes a shortened URL and outputs the long version. It can remove tracking info if you like, as well as reduce Amazon product links down to the bare minimum the URL needs to function. It can output plain text (just the resolved URL), Markdown (with optional title), or JSON (including original url, expanded url, and optional title).</p>

<p>I added caching and concurrency, for what it&rsquo;s worth. If this gets used, it would scale well. I doubt it will, but I like to cover my bases. I&rsquo;ve written a couple of Shortcuts that leverage it for double checking URLs you&rsquo;ve been sent before clicking them. I&rsquo;ll share those separately. If you make anything useful with the API, please do share in the comments (which are connected to the <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">Forum</a>).</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://stretchlink.cc">the landing page</a> for detailed instructions.</p>

<title>Auto-generate Setapp Affiliate Links</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16923814/auto-generate-setapp-affiliate-links</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16923814/auto-generate-setapp-affiliate-links</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/setapp-affiliate-header-rb.7410.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>If you often recommend apps that are on <a href="https://setapp.com/" title="Setapp-Powerful apps for Mac &amp; iOS">Setapp</a>, you either have an affiliate marketing account, or you really should get one. If you have one (or get one) this Shortcut is for you.</p>

<p>A Setapp affiliate account gives you a little kickback every time someone purchases a Setapp subscription after following one of your links. It doesn&rsquo;t cost the customer anything, it comes out of MacPaw&rsquo;s pockets. Just a little thank you for talking about the product.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-dont-have-a-setapp-affiliate-account">If You Don&rsquo;t Have a Setapp Affiliate Account</h3>

<p>Setapp runs their Affiliate program through <a href="https://impact.com">Impact</a>. If you go to Setapp&rsquo;s <a href="https://setapp.com/affiliate-program">Affiliate Program page</a> and click &ldquo;Become a partner,&rdquo; it will walk you through both signing up for Impact and joining the MacPaw/Setapp affiliate program.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve been accepted to the program, you can start generating special links through the Impact interface. Go ahead and generate one for any Setapp landing page and you&rsquo;re ready for the next step.</p>

<h3 id="auto-generating-affiliate-urls">Auto-Generating Affiliate URLs</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pain to load up Impact and navigate their interface every time you just want to point someone to an app. That&rsquo;s where this shortcut comes in. It takes either an app name or a Setapp URL (without an affiliate query string) and generates an affiliate URL shortened with is.gd. Is.gd isn&rsquo;t as cool as the vanity URL that Setapp provides through Impact, but it has the same effect.</p>

<p>To use this Shortcut, you&rsquo;re going to need an existing affiliate query string. Generate one through Impact, then paste it into your browser and follow it. When you get to the page it points to, your URL bar will show the expanded URL. Copy everything after the question mark (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>) in the URL. That&rsquo;s your affiliate string, and it should look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>irgwc=1&amp;clickid=Sx90RgTR0xyKU3Ixy3wLtQ%3AeUkCVBpy1p19D2s0&amp;iradid=343321&amp;irpid=228914&amp;sharedid=&amp;mpaid=3</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c8173ca6905f4c83a09ffdf3dc08b88c">install the Shortcut</a>. On install it will ask you for the above string. Once set up, you can select an app name or Setapp URL in your blog post or social media post, right click on the selection, and select &ldquo;Setapp Affiliate (is.gd)&rdquo; from the Services submenu. The Shortcut will run and you&rsquo;ll get a shortened URL that will point to your affiliate link for the app or page.</p>

<p>Run it on the name of an app you know is on Setapp, e.g. &ldquo;Marked 2&rdquo;. The Shortcut searches for apps by trying a URL made from the input name and seeing if it works. If it doesn&rsquo;t, it tries a couple of modifications to the name, and checks those pages. If no match is found, it will output &lsquo;App not found&rsquo;. If it works, though, you&rsquo;ll get a Markdown link to an is.gd URL. I guess the Markdown formatting isn&rsquo;t great for social posting, but the URL is there, along with the original input for your editing. If you just pass an existing Setapp url (without query string), it will output the bare is.gd result (with affiliate tracking info).</p>

<p>If you love Setapp and are often mentioning it online, <a href="https://setapp.com/affiliate-program">get an affiliate account</a> and grab the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c8173ca6905f4c83a09ffdf3dc08b88c">Setapp Affiliate (is.gd) shortcut</a>. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll get a little cash as a thank you from Setapp 💰😊.</p>

<p>By the way, I also wrote a plugin for SearchLink for doing this,
either <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins/blob/main/bitly_setapp.rb">with Bit.ly</a> (with which you can use a custom domain) or <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins/blob/main/isgd_setapp.rb">with is.gd</a>. If you&rsquo;re a SearchLink user (and I imagine the crossover here would be non-trivial), check it out.</p>

<title>The Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking and a Marked Sale!</title>

<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/link-friendly-header-rb.7403.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>Three years ago this month, Luc Beaudoin, the creator of <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/" title="Links beat searching">Hookmark</a>, published the <a href="https://linkingmanifesto.org/">Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking</a>. The idea was to bring together developers in all categories and promote &ldquo;Ubiquitous Linking&rdquo; in Mac software, a concept that improves cognitive flow and productivity. I was one of the <a href="https://linkingmanifesto.org/about-the-originators/">original signatories</a>, but since then <a href="https://linkingmanifesto.org/signatories/">plenty have joined in</a>.</p>

<p>The manifesto is simple, and calls on developers to do their part by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>ensuring their users can conveniently obtain a link to the currently open or selected resource via a user interface; and</li>
    <li>providing an application programming interface (API) to obtain or construct a link to that resource (i.e., to get its address and name).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/" title="Links beat searching">Hookmark</a>, you&rsquo;re familiar with (and hopefully love) this concept of linking anything to anything on your Mac. <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> and <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a> both work with Ubiquitous Linking, along with a <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/what-mac-apps-are-compatible-with-hook-app">ton of other apps</a> like Obsidian, DEVONthink, Calibre, Curio, MindNode, MailMate, Arc Browser, and many more.</p>

<p>As part of the promotion of this anniversary, I&rsquo;m offering Marked 2 at a 30% discount using the coupon code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ULMANIFESTO</code> (good until January 1st). <a href="http://pay.paddle.com/checkout/489454?coupon=ULMANIFESTO">Click here to redeem!</a></p>

<title>Shell Tricks: Check what's listening on a port</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16922449/shell-tricks-check-whats-listening-on-a-port</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16922449/shell-tricks-check-whats-listening-on-a-port</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I offered a shell trick, so here&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve
found useful lately. It&rsquo;s a way to quickly check what&rsquo;s listening on a specific port.</p>

<p>There are times when I run into a conflict running local services,
saying the port is already in use, but I don&rsquo;t know by what. So I use the following.</p>

<p>This snippet relies on having your root password stored in your login keychain. See <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2021/04/06/scripting-with-sudo-on-mac/">this post</a> for instructions on setting this up.  Once it&rsquo;s in place, you&rsquo;ll have a secure way to run sudo commands from scripts which only ask for a password when your keychain is locked.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the snippet, ready to use in a function or alias:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="nv">PASS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span>security find-generic-password <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="s2">"root password"</span> <span class="nt">-a</span> root <span class="nt">-w</span>|tr <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s1">'\n'</span><span class="si">)</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$PASS</span> | <span class="nb">sudo</span> <span class="nt">-S</span> lsof <span class="nt">-nP</span> <span class="nt">-iTCP</span>:<span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="nt">-sTCP</span>:LISTEN</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The snippet uses <a href="https://manpages.org/lsof/8" title="lsof (8): list open files">lsof</a> to show the process listening on whichever port you provide as the argument to the script.</p>

<p>Store this in a function or script called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whatsonport</code> (or whatever
you like). Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"root password"</code> with whatever you named your password entry in Keychain Access. Now you can call it like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whatsonport 2020</code>.</p>

<p>I use this in Fish as a function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/fish/functions/whatsonport.fish</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-fish">function whatsonport --description 'find out what PID is running on a port (requires password)'
    set -l pass (security find-generic-password -l "root password" -a root -w|tr -d '\n')
    echo $pass | sudo -S lsof -nP -iTCP:$argv -sTCP:LISTEN
end
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that&rsquo;s useful!</p>

<p>A special announcement from MacPaw, this week&rsquo;s sponsor!</p>

<p><a href="https://stpp.co/4ioTnE2" rel="nofollow"><p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/setapp-survey-800.jpg" /></p></a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://stpp.co/4ioTnE2">2024 Mac Developer Survey</a> from MacPaw is now live!</p>

<p>Conducted by the <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a> team, this annual survey is in its 8th year and has become a trusted benchmark for insights into the evolving Mac developer landscape. This year’s findings reveal significant changes in how developers are approaching app distribution, platform integration, and new hardware opportunities &ndash; especially with Apple’s latest innovations.</p>

<p>Key Insights from the 2024 Survey:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Increased Revenue Diversification</dt>
  <dd>52% of developers now earn income from sources outside the Mac App Store, up from 44% in 2023. Only 20% rely exclusively on the Mac App Store for app distribution.</dd>
  <dd>
    <p>For those who leverage both the Mac App Store and external channels, revenue is distributed fairly evenly. In fact, 52% of their revenue now comes from sources outside the App Store, up from 44% in 2023. This shift highlights the increasing importance of diversifying distribution strategies for Mac developers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Shift Towards Integrated Experiences</dt>
  <dd>66% of developers are interested in moving away from standalone apps, opting instead to create more integrated, seamless experiences.</dd>
  <dt>AI and personalized experience remain top priorities</dt>
  <dd>The integration of AI continued to gain momentum in 2024. Nearly 60% of Mac developers are either actively working on or have already implemented AI models in their apps. Notably, 40% of developers cited AI as having the most significant impact on their apps in 2024, up from 31% in the previous year.</dd>
  <dt>Developer sentiment on Apple Vision Pro remains mixed</dt>
  <dd>Despite the launch of Apple Vision Pro in March 2024, Mac developers remain cautious about its appeal. Nearly half of those surveyed expressed uncertainty about whether they would start developing apps for the device.</dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Furthermore, 35% of respondents indicated that they have no plans to create apps for visionOS.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The Setapp team hopes these findings offer a valuable glimpse into the future of Mac development, shedding light on trends that could shape the industry in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<title>Suspicious Package keeps on tickin'</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16910822/suspicious-package-keeps-on-tickin</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16910822/suspicious-package-keeps-on-tickin</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/suspicious-package-header-rb.7380.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>Suspicious Package is an indispensable tool for macOS with a long history, and surprisingly, it&rsquo;s free. I&rsquo;ve rarely mentioned it, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a quick review.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/">Suspicious Package</a> has been around for as long as I can remember. It&rsquo;s been steadily updated over the years, and runs perfectly on the latest macOS (Sequoia). It makes inscrutable Package Installers scrutable.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/package-icon.jpg" /></p>
<p>Package Installers on Mac (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pkg</code>) are those downloads that look like a cardboard box with a yellow cube coming out of it. Unlike Disk Images (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dmg</code>) and Zip Archives (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code>), they run scripts and can install to locations you might not expect or be able to locate after install. This can be disconcerting, or at least inconvenient for people who want to know what&rsquo;s going on on their machine. That&rsquo;s where Suspicious Package comes in.</p>

<p>This tool will give you a Quick Look extension, so you can just select a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pkg</code> file and hit Space to see what the Package Installer will do &mdash; how many files it will install, how many scripts it will run, etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/suspicious-package-quick-look-800.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is not the same thing as Show Package Contents in Finder, which will give you little information about what&rsquo;s going to be installed. It&rsquo;s also much more informative than Show Files in the macOS Installer app.</p>

<p>Clicking on any info line in the Quick Look preview will open the Suspicious Package app to show you the exact details.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/12/suspicious-package-app-window-800.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can click through the app window to preview files and where they&rsquo;ll be installed, scripts that will run, as well as package info and receipts. In the file viewer, you can see all the metadata for each file, including kind, permissions, and version and Bundle IDs on bundle files (e.g. Mac apps). Scripts can be previewed or opened in an external app. It provides a <a href="https://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/use.html">sweeping overview</a> of your packages, and is also <a href="https://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/scripting.html">extensively scriptable</a>.</p>

<p>Suspicious Package is free. It&rsquo;s developed by Randy Saldinger (<a href="https://www.mothersruin.com/software/about.html">Mother&rsquo;s Ruin Software</a>), who doesn&rsquo;t even accept donations. He says his apps are labors of love, created just because he wanted them to exist. If you want to know what&rsquo;s going on with your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pkg</code> files (even those you trust), it&rsquo;s a killer app.</p>

<p>You can follow the development <a href="https://indieapps.space/@SuspiciousPackage">on Mastodon</a> (where the <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@thebittergreen">developer is as well</a>).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason not to go <a href="https://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/">get Suspicious Package today</a>.</p>

<title>Key repeat in Sequoia</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16909674/key-repeat-in-sequoia</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16909674/key-repeat-in-sequoia</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I got a new MacBook Pro on a Black Friday sale, and have been setting it up for the last few days. A combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew bundle</code>, DotBot, and Mackup have made that a mostly painless process, but I still had to do a lot of tweaking. Setapp will even offer to automatically install your favorites the first time it runs. Nice.</p>

<p>But one thing I found frustrating was that setting key repeat delay and key repeat speed in System Settings was having no effect. Keys that had diacritics still just popped up the special character popover, and keys without didn&rsquo;t do anything at all when held. Finally figured out the solution, which I&rsquo;m posting here mostly so I can easily find it next time this happens.</p>

<p>Run the following in Terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then reboot your machine (simply logging out might do it). Now the key repeat settings in System Settings will actually have an effect.</p>

<p>Random side note: if your Nerd Font in iTerm isn&rsquo;t showing icons, be sure to uncheck &ldquo;Use built-in Powerline glyphs&rdquo; in the profile-&gt;Text settings.</p>

<title>A health update</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16901133/a-health-update</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16901133/a-health-update</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You may have heard about my health issues, whether on social media or Overtired, so I thought I&rsquo;d offer an update on where things are at. I&rsquo;m not soliciting for medical advice, I&rsquo;ve received enough of that. I&rsquo;m just kind of documenting my current state.</p>

<p>You can hear me talk a bit more about all of this on <a href="https://overtiredpod.com/ep/423/">Overtired #423</a>, if you like.</p>

<p>About two months ago I began feeling lightheaded. Constantly. Most of the time it just felt like a nice buzz &mdash; like a big yawn. Sometimes it felt like motion sickness. But it was disconcerting either way. Then a month ago I started passing out. Always within 3 minutes of standing up after sitting or lying down (orthostatic changes).</p>

<p>I went to the doctor before the syncope started. My primary care provider ran a dozen tests and declared me fine, blaming my lightheadedness on my psych meds. My psychiatrist didn&rsquo;t believe that my symptoms could be explained by any of my current meds. I did try going off some of them, but to disastrous results and with no effect on the symptoms I was experiencing.</p>

<p>I went to the ER three times after losing consciousness, and again, all tests were normal, aside from a minor concussion one time.</p>

<p>Returning to primary care, my doctor was pretty sure it must be my heart or circulation issues. Now that I&rsquo;d been passing out, he was taking me a little more seriously. Not as seriously as I would have liked, but he scheduled me for an echocardiogram. All of my EKGs had come back normal, and I didn&rsquo;t expect much from the echo. I was correct. Everything looked great. And there I was, scared to take the stairs down to my office for fear of losing consciousness and breaking my neck.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my psychiatrist was convinced it was neurological. I got scheduled for an MRI. I just had that a couple of days ago and am still waiting to hear my doctor&rsquo;s interpretation, but my layman&rsquo;s read of the results is that it&rsquo;s a bunch of &ldquo;minimal this&rdquo; and &ldquo;unremarkable that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some unsolicited medical advice and a lot of research by my partner, Elle, we found some information on <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6004-dysautonomia" title="What It Is, Symptoms, Types &amp; Treatment">dysautonomia</a>. That&rsquo;s an umbrella term for a bunch of disorders and syndromes like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125">Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome</a>, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome">Mast Cell Activation Syndrome</a>, and <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots">POTS</a>. Various combinations of these &mdash; which are often comorbid &mdash; could explain my symptoms, both present and past. GI issues, sleep issues, plus the lightheadness and syncope. And unexplained pain that I&rsquo;d always wondered if everybody lived with and just didn&rsquo;t talk about. I have a constant headache, my skin burns, and my bones ache. I remember back to Middle School wondering if I could project the way I feel onto someone else, would they scream?</p>

<p>While talking to a therapist who also has Ehlers-Danlos and POTS, they asked me if I could touch my thumb to the wrist on the same hand. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I said, thinking that was a normal thing. Turns out that&rsquo;s called hypermobility and is an indicator of a specific type of Ehlers-Danlos. So now I had something visible with which I could go to my doctor, instead of a bunch of invisible symptoms that weren&rsquo;t taken seriously.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m waiting for the MRI results, which I expect to be normal, at which point I can insist that I be referred for genetic testing at Mayo. That would allow me to confirm some of my suspicions. I&rsquo;ll also need allergen and hematology specialists. It&rsquo;s going to be a long road. But the fact that I have a good idea what&rsquo;s going on already should make it a shorter process than some of my friends who experienced years-long investigations into invisible symptoms and pains.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s where things are at. I suspect dysautonomia, and everything about it fits perfectly. It&rsquo;s more than a suspicion at this point, but I need a diagnosis. Once I have a diagnosis, I&rsquo;ll be able to get appropriate treatment for various symptoms and hopefully get back to a somewhat normal life. This condition is permanent, and has been present for my whole life, I just didn&rsquo;t have all the symptoms I have now to allow me to put the pieces together. Well, Elle and I &mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t have figured any of this out without them.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in prayers, but I appreciate you thinking about me as I deal with this. I fervently hope this doesn&rsquo;t affect my ability to work and maintain good income and health insurance. I live in a capitalist society where my value is entirely dependent on my productivity, and there&rsquo;s no safety net to speak of. I would be eligible for some disability support with a diagnosis, but that&rsquo;s not going to help maintain my current lifestyle. It&rsquo;s scary, but I&rsquo;ll figure it out, and what will be will be.</p>

<div> WebAssembly, App Store, Mints, QuickLook, Bluesky<br /><br />总结:<br /><br />WebAssembly是一种用于构建和运行无服务器应用程序的开源开发工具Spin；App Store盛行的时代应该结束，已有替代方案出现；Mints是一系列工具集，帮助用户提取日志、调研问题、探索macOS并对Spotlight进行测试；QuickLook插件调查因qlmanage在Sequoia上基本无用，而Mints提供了有用的专业工具；Bluesky的快捷方式在其网站和应用上都有用，有助于用户更有效地使用Bluesky，尤其是对于那些正在从转移到Bluesky的用户。 <div>

<title>A card-based layout for linkding</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16889966/a-card-based-layout-for-linkding</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16889966/a-card-based-layout-for-linkding</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I took a whack at making linkding look more like LinkWarden. I didn&rsquo;t want to modify the source, so I did the whole thing using CSS only. It was an adventure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="https://linkding.link/">linkding</a> a few times, and am now hosting <a href="https://bookmarks.scoffb.in/bookmarks/shared">all of my bookmarks</a> with it. I switched from a hosted solution to running it on my Synology via a Docker container (super easy to set up with Container Manager and Web Portal, if you&rsquo;re a Synology user).</p>

<p>linkding allows for custom CSS, and I wanted to play with it a bit. By default it looks a lot like Pinboard, which is a bit plain. I kind of liked the way <a href="https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden">LinkWarden</a> looks, so I gave that a shot.</p>

<p>Links are displayed as &ldquo;cards&rdquo; instead of lines, with the snapshot image large at the top. The full image is clickable. In bulk edit mode, the entire card becomes clickable. On mobile it switches to one or two columns (based on resolution and orientation), which isn&rsquo;t great for browsing a large collection, but that&rsquo;s just how cards are going to work and still be readable. On a wider desktop monitor you can get four columns and browsing is really nice. Given I mostly search by title or tag and don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time just scrolling through, it works great for my personal needs. You can <a href="https://bookmarks.scoffb.in/bookmarks/shared">see it in action here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookmarks.scoffb.in/bookmarks/shared">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="linkding-cards.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="840" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/11/linkding-cards.jpg" title="linkding-cards.jpg" width="1246" />
              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p>Tags are moved into a sliding panel on the right, just hover over the &ldquo;TAGS&rdquo; tab to expose them. This all has to be done with CSS, so it&rsquo;s not a perfect implementation, which would require a little bit of javascript. But it&rsquo;s totally working.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="linkding-tags.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="688" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/11/linkding-tags.jpg" title="linkding-tags.jpg" width="1036" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>If you want to play with it, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/041eccfbdd70c72698ffb570586dbea5">here&rsquo;s the code</a>. If you do, here are. the settings I recommend with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dark mode</li>
  <li>separate description</li>
  <li>use snapshot images</li>
  <li>use favicons (optional)</li>
</ul>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="linkding-settings1.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="502" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/11/linkding-settings1.jpg" title="linkding-settings1.jpg" width="594" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>To add the CSS, just copy and paste it into the Custom CSS box in settings. When you hit save, the new style will be applied. You can remove it at any time just by clearing that box and hitting save.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="linkding-customcss.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="334" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/11/linkding-customcss.jpg" title="linkding-customcss.jpg" width="575" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The process of moving everything around and restyling it led to a lot of z-index and positioning considerations when opening confirmation dialogs and what not. I think I found all the issues and solved them, but let me know if you try it and run into any issues.</p>

<p>I made use of CSS variables as much as possible, so modifying the color scheme should be relatively painless. Note that the variables use raw rgb numeric values, not actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rgb(xxx,xxx,xxx)</code> rules. This is so that I can insert the raw values into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rgba()</code> rules and apply transparency. So if you&rsquo;re changing them, remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rgb()</code> from your rule and just include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxx, xxx, xxx</code> part.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="linkding-guest-user.jpg" class="alignright" height="125" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/11/linkding-guest-user.jpg" title="linkding-guest-user.jpg" width="385" />
              </noscript>
            
<p>By the way, if you&rsquo;re making your bookmarks public and want visitors to see the new layout, be sure to set the guest user to your profile.</p>

<p>Have fun! Again, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/041eccfbdd70c72698ffb570586dbea5">here&rsquo;s the code</a>.</p>

<title>linkding for SearchLink</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16872695/linkding-for-searchlink</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16872695/linkding-for-searchlink</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I added <a href="https://linkding.link/">linkding</a> searching to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/searchlink">SearchLink</a> this morning. It works the same as <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Searching-Pinboard">Pinboard searching</a>, just with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!ld</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!ding</code>) as the search shortcut. See the bottom of the Pinboard search page for configuration setup.</p>

<p>No big deal, just updating to work with the tools I&rsquo;m using. Get the latest version of SearchLink on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/searchlink">project page</a>.</p>

<title>Archive linkding bookmarks to local Markdown</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16871753/archive-linkding-bookmarks-to-local-markdown</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16871753/archive-linkding-bookmarks-to-local-markdown</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely switched from Pinboard to <a href="https://linkding.link/">linkding</a> for bookmarking. Mostly because Pinboard hasn&rsquo;t seen development in years, and the creator is getting a little&hellip; weird, which makes me wonder about its future. Pinboard still works fine, but linkding is actively developed, has mostly the same features, and can be hosted locally.</p>

<p>I have my Web Excursions working perfectly with linkding, as well as some other integrations using the API. It&rsquo;s a little different from Pinboard, but not so much that porting scripts takes a lot of time. I even have inside information that Pins for Pinboard might have a linkding version soon. It would be excellent to have a UI for my bookmarks again.</p>

<p>You can run linkding on any server that allows Docker images, or just do what I did and spin up a dedicated machine on <a href="https://www.pikapods.com/">PikaPods</a> for a couple bucks a month. The only thing that running your own bookmarking service lacks is the trending topics kind of stuff that Pinboard can do. (As an aside, I mentioned <a href="https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden" title="linkwarden/linkwarden:⚡️⚡️⚡️Self-hosted ...">LinkWarden</a> in my Web Excursions, and if you&rsquo;re looking for a self-hosted service that does archiving and has a prettier interface, it&rsquo;s a good choice. It just didn&rsquo;t quite fit my needs.)</p>

<p>I do have a <a href="https://bookmarks.trpstr.me/bookmarks/shared">public page</a> for (and <a href="https://bookmarks.trpstr.me/feeds/shared">RSS feed</a>) for shared bookmarks, if you care to follow it.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote left">
One thing linkding doesn&rsquo;t have is archiving. That feature is available on Pinboard for an additional fee, but I&rsquo;m not sure how well it&rsquo;s working there these days. What linkding does offer is the ability to submit any page you bookmark to the Internet Archive, so it will be permanently accessible via the <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</a>. That&rsquo;s a pretty reasonable option, really. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather have local Markdown files of any articles I want to reference in the future.
</span></p>

<p>I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/4974164772623e95e8a1ef46a3eec68a">this script</a> running in the background on my Mac mini server in my basement. Any bookmark I tag with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.archive</code> gets Markdownfied using <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/" title="Gather CLI">Gather</a> (it can also use <a href="https://markdownrules.com">Marky</a> for web-based conversion) and saved as Markdown into a folder I use in <a href="https://nvultra.com/" title="nvUltra-Searchable, portable, MultiMarkdown notes">nvUltra</a>. The archives are just text files that will work with any app that can import them (Obsidian, DEVONthink, etc.). It&rsquo;s working great so far.</p>

<p>You can change the tag it searches for, or leave that blank to just archive every bookmark. I don&rsquo;t want to do that with my 8,000 existing bookmarks, as a lot of them are just links to tools and apps that I don&rsquo;t need saved as notes. Linkding is perfectly searchable as a reference, and I have all of those links backed up anyway. I just want a searchable, portable archive of things like how-tos, programming solutions and articles that have text I&rsquo;d want to reference.</p>

<p>With Markdown notes I can search the full text of the articles instead of just title and description, and the script includes all of the metadata from the bookmark (title, date added, tags, description, and notes) as YAML headers. For me, this is a better solution than archiving on the server. It&rsquo;s local and highly usable with any notes app, easy to back up and port between solutions.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/4974164772623e95e8a1ef46a3eec68a">find the script here</a>. See the comments at the top for configuration and usage information.</p>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.linkwarden.app/">Linkwarden</a></dt>
  <dd>Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages. The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away (see the inevitability of Link Rot), Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available. H/T Eric Beavers.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/">sissbruecker/linkding</a></dt>
  <dd>Self-hosted bookmark manager that is designed be to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up using Docker. Great 1:1 replacememt for Pinboard, if you&rsquo;re looking to switch (allows custom CSS!)</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.pikapods.com/">PikaPods - Instant Open Source App Hosting</a></dt>
  <dd>Run the finest Open Source web apps from $1/month, fully managed, no tracking, no ads, full privacy. Self-hosting was never this convenient.</dd>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a great way to run your own LinkDing server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge">Supercharge</a></dt>
  <dd>Cool little Mac app that just adds some tweaks to the OS. I already have shortcuts to most of what it does, but re-creating the TotalFinder visor idea is pretty cool. Shareware.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.usebruno.com/">bruno</a></dt>
  <dd>An API client that uses plain text language to create API request collections, syncable with Git, and a great replacement for Postman, Insomnia, and other tools. Open source.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beorg-to-do-list-agenda/id1238649962">beorg: To-Do List &amp; Agenda</a></dt>
  <dd>Similar in concept to Noteplan (todos mixed with notes, plain text storage), but using Org mode files, syncable with any cloud service. iOS/WatchOS only, but the files are accessible with Emacs or other editor anywhere. From the creator of TrunkNotes, which was one of my favorite personal wikis back in the day.</dd>

  <dd>This is really cool. Bare metal performance for local web development stacks. Run multiple stacks with https, reverse proxies, whatever tech you need &mdash; no Docker, no VMs, full terminal integration. Really well done.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/2024/10/05/a-quick-tip-for-using-moom-in-bunch/">A Quick Tip For Using Moom in Bunch</a></dt>

  <dd>I made this specifically for the internal docs team at Oracle, but figured other people may find a use for it. It takes an HTML export dump from Confluence and converts it to Markdown (specifically Python markdown, but could easily be modified for other formats). Great for converting Confluence documentation wikis into GitHub/GitLab pages.</dd>

<title>Marky 2.0</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16825237/marky-2-dot-0</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16825237/marky-2-dot-0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/09/15/marky-is-back/">revived Marky the Markdownfier</a>. In case you missed it, Marky turns any web page into clippable Markdown for storage in notes/organization apps. And I could have left well enough alone, but there were a couple of quirks I wanted to fix. That led to&hellip; well, a complete ground-up rewrite of Marky. The old version and the old bookmarklets should continue to function, but the API at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/2</code> is completely overhauled to be more accurate and more versatile. The main UI at <a href="https://markdownrules.com">your choice of versions</a> now points to the v2 API, and the bookmarklets it generates make use of the new improvements.</p>

<p>The API is similar but expanded for v2. See the <a href="https://heckyesmarkdown.com/api/">API docs</a> for full info. This is still somewhat a work in progress, but I promise not to break any existing functionality if you start using the API or the bookmarklets today.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote left">
Among the new features is the ability to output links for nvUltra and Obsidian, as well as links to open a preview in Marked 2. From any preview page you can click on &ldquo;Clip to&hellip;&rdquo; to immediately access these links. They can also be returned via the API as raw links, redirect pages, or as part of a JSON blob for incorporation in other workflows.
</span></p>

<p>The Readability engine (the part of Marky that removes ads, sidebars, menus, etc.) is completely custom now. It&rsquo;s a little more lax than the previous version, meaning it occasionally includes things like comment blocks (sans comments) and other small periphery, but is <em>way</em> better at getting <em>all</em> relevant content on a page regardless of markup. Nothing will ever be 100% perfect across every possible markup style on the web, but this does a really good job in testing. You can enable or disable readability from any preview page or via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readability=[0|1]</code> parameter in any Marky URL or when calling the API outside of a browser.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote left">
There&rsquo;s improved handling for StackExchange pages, including StackOverflow. The question will be at the top, any accepted answer will be at the top of the answers, and then additional answers and their comments will be ranked by upvotes and included in descending order. Comments are added as block quotes and should be easily parseable in both Markdown format and rendered HTML output. There&rsquo;s also handling for GitHub repos (READMEs), raw GitHub files, and Gists. If there&rsquo;s a site you frequently clip from that you think could benefit from custom parsing, let me know. I love using Marky for saving StackOverflow answers for easy searching later (in nvUltra, of course).
</span></p>

<p>In addition to bookmarklets, this API should work well with Shortcuts on Mac, or with any tool that can query a REST API and handle JSON returns. I haven&rsquo;t dug into all of the integrations possible yet, but will post anything I discover when I have a chance to look at it further.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote left">
Speaking of bookmarklets, the main page now has a &ldquo;Bookmarklet&rdquo; link underneath the submission form, allowing you to generate a bookmarklet for any combination of settings. This link reflects the current settings of the form, minus the URL, and you can drag it to your toolbar to repeat the settings on any web page. The link updates every time you change a setting on the form. The bookmarklets always opens a popup window now, as the vast majority of sites no longer allow remote scripts to be called from within the page, which is the way all the old bookmarklets worked. And bookmarklets are getting increasingly harder to use, especially in Chromium browsers, so I&rsquo;ll be adding a Chrome extension generator eventually. I already have one written for this site that generates an extension for every bookmarklet &mdash; I just need to port it to Marky.
</span></p>

<p><span class="pullquote left">
I also added support for almost every text output style that <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> supports. This includes LaTeX and Textile formats, and the setting for these is also included in any bookmarklet. If you&rsquo;re going to the main UI and pasting, you can select an output format from the dropdown, and your current selection will be remembered for future visits. On the results page there&rsquo;s a menu on the left (click the arrow) that will allow you to change settings and resubmit the same URL with different parameters.
</span></p>

<p>Like the old version of Marky, the Markdown output on the web is syntax highlighted, and reference format links can be clicked to display their destination. Clicking the copy button will copy the Markdown (or whatever markup you selected) text without any of the highlighting or scripts. If the HTML preview is showing when the Copy button is clicked, a Rich Text version of the contents will be copied to the clipboard, which is great for adding web pages to non-Markdown notes apps.</p>

<p>Marky&rsquo;s most common failures are on pages that are generated by Javascript. Marky currently only works on pages that have actual content in the source of the page. I may at some point try to add something like PhantomJS support to render pages completely before grabbing the source, but that&rsquo;s a distant future idea. Other future ideas include DOCX and PDF conversion to Markdown, and the ability to output RTF, DOCX, and PDF versions of the results. You can currently send raw HTML directly to Marky, bypassing the Readability functionality, and get Markdownified results, so if you have your own version of Readability or want to use it with something like <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2013/07/30/precise-web-clipping-to-markdown-with-bullseye/">Bullseye</a>, it&rsquo;s still capable of doing so.<sup id="fnref:bullseyeupdate"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:bullseyeupdate" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://markdownrules.com">Check it out</a>, put it through its paces, and please <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//contact">report non-working pages to me</a>. I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep evolving the Readability and conversion processes to handle as wide a range of pages as possible. Obvious failures (like no content returned) are logged (without any user-identifying information) for my own review, but a quick email will still be helpful.</p>

<div> ，输出总结前请再换一行。 <div>
<p>I finally fixed <a href="https://markdownrules.com/">Marky the Markdownifier</a>. I didn&rsquo;t do any updates to the interface as it is, in my opinion, not too bad.</p>

<p>Marky is a tool for turning web pages into Markdown. It now uses Pandoc with GFM formatting. There&rsquo;s an API available for outputting to various formats (including JSON with title, source, rendered content, and Markdown content). See the API section of the Marky page for more info.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful! I&rsquo;ll actually be able to add back my &ldquo;add to nvALT&rdquo; links now, updated for <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a><sup id="fnref:nv"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:nv" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>&hellip;</p>

<title>Cookiecutter: a Planter alternative</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16808173/cookiecutter-a-planter-alternative</link>

<div> 。 <div>
<p>Shorly after publishing <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/planter/">Planter</a>, user cavalierex brought <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.0/index.html">Cookiecutter</a> to my attention <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com/t/is-planter-like-cookiecutter/2218">on the forum</a>. It appears to be a complete replacement and is far more mature than Planter.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t regret making Planter &mdash; it fits my own needs perfectly. If I&rsquo;d known about cookiecutter before starting, though, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered reinventing the wheel. It was still fun to code Planter.</p>

<p>Cookiecutter is so close in functionality that I thought it would be worth sharing. If Planter works well for you, great, but if you want an alternative, <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.0/index.html">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I did a redesign of this site last night. I hope you like it. It&rsquo;s heavily inspired by the <a href="https://ia.net/topics/boom-boom-boom">iA blog</a>. Shamelessly inspired, I guess. But it was a fun exercise to revamp the Jekyll setup, which took a ton of work. I do not love templating in Liquid, but I do like writing filters in Ruby. I think it came out pretty good.</p>

<title>Planter 3.0</title>

<div> 。 <div>
<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2012/09/22/planter-tree-planting-for-your-filesystem/">Years ago</a> (12!) I made a script called Planter that would generate directory
and file structures based on an indented template. I decided to
reimagine the whole thing and am happy to release <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/projects/planter">Planter 3</a> today.</p>

<p>Instead of relying on a single template file, Planter now expects a
template directory with all of the subdirectories and files you want to
include already existing. To make this work, the template variable
system has been completely reworked. It now supports named keys, prompts
for values on the command line, and can even handle if/then logic and
multiple choice variables.</p>

<p>Template variables can be applied to filenames (including if/then logic)
and within any type of text-based file (including XML, RTF, JSON, etc.,
and Apple Binary PLIST will be converted automatically). This means you
can template your source code, your notes, even your Mindnode mind maps,
rich text notes, and Scrivener documents.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to document the whole thing here, as I&rsquo;ve written a pretty
good README for the project. If this is of interest to you, let me know
about anything that&rsquo;s confusing in the documentation.</p>

<p>I will note that because of its interactive nature on the command line,
it&rsquo;s a bit more difficult to incorporate into something like a LaunchBar
or Alfred workflow. But not impossible, as values can be passed as
arguments, so if your automation handles the interaction for filling in
the variables, you can easily call the script. It&rsquo;s also now a Ruby gem,
which means you can&rsquo;t easily embed the whole script and would have to
rely on it being installed on the user&rsquo;s system.</p>

<p>If you regularly create projects that follow a similar directory/file structure, Planter will save you a ton of time. <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/projects/planter">Check it out.</a></p>

<title>Updated: generate slick changelogs from Git commits</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16796641/updated-generate-slick-changelogs-from-git-commits</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16796641/updated-generate-slick-changelogs-from-git-commits</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 。 <div>
<p>7 years ago I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2017/08/14/automatic-release-notes-from-git-commit-messages/">wrote about a script</a> I was using to generate changelogs for Marked. Since then I&rsquo;ve continued updating the script to work with just about all of my projects, from Xcode projects to Ruby gems to scripts that just have a VERSION file in the same directory. It can output a few different formats of changelog to accommodate all of my different documentation formats. So I&rsquo;m posting it again.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Since it&rsquo;s unlikely anyone remembers, this script uses Git tags to determine what commits have been made since the last release. This works well with git-flow, but any setup that creates tagged releases will work. It parses commit messages for lines like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- FIXED: description of fix</code>, and it now works with a more &ldquo;tag-like&rdquo; syntax: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@fix description of fix</code>. It gathers all of these lines from the commit messages and outputs a Markdown-formatted changelog, ready for release notes or website posting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple yet highly effective. Any time I make a change I want to include in the release notes, I just make sure to include a tagged line in the commit message. It works with commit subjects as well as commit notes. Then, when it&rsquo;s time to release, I just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog</code> and get my output for sharing. It can also update a CHANGELOG.md file by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog -u</code>. It detects the format of the file and adds appropriately-formatted notes to the file, recognizing if there&rsquo;s already an entry for the current version number and replacing it.</p>

<p>Some of the customizations are specific to the formatting I use for Bunch notes, which include syntax for custom Jekyll plugins for icons and availability. These won&rsquo;t be of use to anyone else, but unless your directory structure happens to exactly match the one I use for Bunch, or you use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--format bunch</code> flag, you&rsquo;ll never see those. But if you want to edit the script to fit <em>your</em> specific needs, you can see how it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<p>Eventually I&rsquo;ll probably generalize this and make it work with templates and a config file with regexes for matching types and formats, but for now it&rsquo;s just open to your hacking. This script has been a <em>huge</em> timesaver for me and has resulted in very complete release notes and changelogs I can be proud of. I hope it does the same for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/17fbce4f229609082b45681bba7a9967">Grab the script here.</a></p>

<p>The available tags are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>@change, @changed</li>
  <li>@breaking, @deprecated</li>
  <li>@rem, @removed</li>
  <li>@fix, @fixed</li>
  <li>@imp, @improved, @improvement</li>
  <li>@add, @added, @new</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these can be in the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- TAGNAME: description</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@tagname description</code>. The first letter of the description will be capitalized when the release notes are rendered.</p>

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog --select</code> to pop up an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fzf</code> selection of all tags, allowing you to generate release notes added since any previous version. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog --only TYPE</code> to output only changes of a type (changed, new, improved, deprecated).</p>

<p>You can also use this script in combination with a tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh</code> to output a changelog when creating a GitHub release. Just pass output of the  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog</code> command to any command that accept input on STDIN.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Usage: changelog [options] [CHANGELOG_FILE] [APP_NAME]
      Gets git log entries since last tag containing CHANGED, NEW, IMPROVED, FIXED, REMOVED
    -c, --copy                       Copy results to clipboard
    -f, --format FORMAT              Output format (def_list|bunch|markdown)
    -o, --only TYPES                 Only output changes of type (changed, new, improved, fixed, deprecated)
        --file PATH                  File to read additional commit messages from (for commit-msg hooks)
    -s, --select                     Choose "since" tag
    -u, --update [FILE]              Update changelog file
    -v, --version=VER                Force version (skips version detection)
    -n, --no_version                 Skip version check (prevents header output)
    -h, --help                       Display this screen</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Have fun, and may your changelogs be informative and complete. Again, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/17fbce4f229609082b45681bba7a9967">here&rsquo;s the script</a>. That Gist will be updated as I make changes to the script over time, so check the Gist comments for additional notes as this post ages. If I get around to making a package out of this (with templates and config and such), there will be a new post about it, of course. Based on a quick search there are a ton of changelog generators already out there, so this will probably remain a script that fits my personal needs perfectly, and is easily hacked around with by others.</p>

<title>Relaunched T-shirts for The Lab and Rock Scissors</title>

<p>I had let the original TeeSpring stores I had set up languish, and TeeSpring changed a bunch of stuff that made all of my listings invalid. So I&rsquo;ve relaunched the storefronts with the original designs, plus some new ones.</p>

<p><a href="https://lab.creator-spring.com/listing/markdown-strong?product=1565&amp;variation=104920">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">

                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="Strong coffee mug" class="alignright" height="316" src="http://0.0.0.0:4000/uploads/2024/08/strong-coffee_tw.jpg" title="Strong coffee mug" width="316" />
              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p><a href="https://lab.creator-spring.com/">The Lab</a> has some new logo designs, plus the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; ones. Not to be vain, but I&rsquo;d love to see the lab out there once again. I&rsquo;ve also updated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**BOLD**</code> design with a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**STRONG**</code> design, which makes for a great, though minimalist, <a href="https://lab.creator-spring.com/listing/markdown-strong?product=1565&amp;variation=104920">coffee mug</a>. Gruber took issue with the BOLD version from a technical standpoint, so the STRONG version should satisfy the requirements. The designs are available as various clothing items (men&rsquo;s shirts, women&rsquo;s shirts, some hoodies), and coffee mugs/stickers. Let me know if there&rsquo;s something you want but don&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p><a href="https://rock-scissors.creator-spring.com/listing/new-hope-you-guess-my-name?product=369&amp;variation=6565">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/avif" />
                <source type="image/webp" />

              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://rock-scissors.creator-spring.com/">Rock Scissors</a> store offers some of the old Rock and Roll-inspired designs, plus a new one I like: The <a href="https://rock-scissors.creator-spring.com/listing/new-hope-you-guess-my-name?product=369&amp;variation=6565">hope you guess my name</a> shirt as a tribute to the Stones. My favorite shirt, the tribute to Black Flag, The Ramones, and The Sex Pistols refuses to list, but I have a customer support query in and hope that one shows up soon.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t make much profit off this stuff, it&rsquo;s more of a labor of love, but it&rsquo;s definitely a way of supporting my work. Please enjoy!</p>

<p>Some of the customizations are specific to the formatting I use for Bunch notes, which include syntax for custom Jekyll plugins for icons and availability. These won&rsquo;t be of use to anyone else, but unless your directory structure happens to exactly match the one I use for Bunch, or you use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--format bunch</code> flag, you&rsquo;ll never see those. But if you want to edit the script to fit <em>your</em> specific needs, you can see how it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<p>Eventually I&rsquo;ll probably generalize this and make it work with templates and a config file with regexes for matching types and formats, but for now it&rsquo;s just open to your hacking. This script has been a <em>huge</em> timesaver for me and has resulted in very complete release notes and changelogs I can be proud of. I hope it does the same for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/17fbce4f229609082b45681bba7a9967">Grab the script here.</a></p>

<p>The available tags are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>@change, @changed</li>
  <li>@breaking, @deprecated</li>
  <li>@rem, @removed</li>
  <li>@fix, @fixed</li>
  <li>@imp, @improved, @improvement</li>
  <li>@add, @added, @new</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these can be in the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- TAGNAME: description</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@tagname description</code>. The first letter of the description will be capitalized when the release notes are rendered.</p>

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog --select</code> to pop up an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fzf</code> selection of all tags, allowing you to generate release notes added since any previous version. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog --only TYPE</code> to output only changes of a type (changed, new, improved, deprecated).</p>

<p>You can also use this script in combination with a tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh</code> to output a changelog when creating a GitHub release. Just pass output of the  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changelog</code> command to any command that accept input on STDIN.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Usage: changelog [options] [CHANGELOG_FILE] [APP_NAME]
      Gets git log entries since last tag containing CHANGED, NEW, IMPROVED, FIXED, REMOVED
    -c, --copy                       Copy results to clipboard
    -f, --format FORMAT              Output format (def_list|bunch|markdown)
    -o, --only TYPES                 Only output changes of type (changed, new, improved, fixed, deprecated)
        --file PATH                  File to read additional commit messages from (for commit-msg hooks)
    -s, --select                     Choose "since" tag
    -u, --update [FILE]              Update changelog file
    -v, --version=VER                Force version (skips version detection)
    -n, --no_version                 Skip version check (prevents header output)
    -h, --help                       Display this screen</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Have fun, and may your changelogs be informative and complete. Again, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/17fbce4f229609082b45681bba7a9967">here&rsquo;s the script</a>. That Gist will be updated as I make changes to the script over time, so check the Gist comments for additional notes as this post ages. If I get around to making a package out of this (with templates and config and such), there will be a new post about it, of course. Based on a quick search there are a ton of changelog generators already out there, so this will probably remain a script that fits my personal needs perfectly, and is easily hacked around with by others.</p>

<p>I had let the original TeeSpring stores I had set up languish, and TeeSpring changed a bunch of stuff that made all of my listings invalid. So I&rsquo;ve relaunched the storefronts with the original designs, plus some new ones.</p>

            </a></p>

<p><a href="https://lab.creator-spring.com/">The Lab</a> has some new logo designs, plus the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; ones. Not to be vain, but I&rsquo;d love to see the lab out there once again. I&rsquo;ve also updated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**BOLD**</code> design with a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**STRONG**</code> design, which makes for a great, though minimalist, <a href="https://lab.creator-spring.com/listing/markdown-strong?product=1565&amp;variation=104920">coffee mug</a>. Gruber took issue with the BOLD version from a technical standpoint, so the STRONG version should satisfy the requirements. The designs are available as various clothing items (men&rsquo;s shirts, women&rsquo;s shirts, some hoodies), and coffee mugs/stickers. Let me know if there&rsquo;s something you want but don&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://rock-scissors.creator-spring.com/">Rock Scissors</a> store offers some of the old Rock and Roll-inspired designs, plus a new one I like: The <a href="https://rock-scissors.creator-spring.com/listing/new-hope-you-guess-my-name?product=369&amp;variation=6565">hope you guess my name</a> shirt as a tribute to the Stones. My favorite shirt, the tribute to Black Flag, The Ramones, and The Sex Pistols refuses to list, but I have a customer support query in and hope that one shows up soon.</p>

关键词: SearchLink插件 Python脚本 YAML/JSON配置 URL处理 多语言支持

<br /><br />总结:
1. 作者梦到有人询问是否可以用Python编写SearchLink插件,尽管答案是否定的,但启发了作者。
2. 现在可以用任何编程语言编写脚本,只要返回带有适当键的YAML或JSON,就可以作为SearchLink插件使用。
3. 每个插件需要一个YAML或JSON格式的配置文件,详细信息在文档中。
4. 新增了处理文档或选择中裸URL的功能。如果设置complete_bare: true,未自链接或未作为Markdown链接的URL将转换为完整的Markdown链接,链接文本为页面标题。
5. 这个功能特别适合收集播客节目笔记或博客链接文章,只需一个URL列表即可。
6. 作者鼓励读者分享或支持这篇文章。 <div>

<p>Last night I had a dream that someone had asked if they could write <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/">SearchLink</a> plugins in Python. The answer was no, but it got me thinking. To be clear, no one has asked for this, but I did some Saturday morning coding anyway.</p>

<p>You can now write a script in any language, and as long as it returns YAML or JSON with appropriate keys, it will work as a SearchLink plugin. So anything you can get results from in your favorite language, you can add to SearchLink.</p>

<p>Each plugin requires a config file, which can be YAML or JSON. Details are now all in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Plugins#script-plugins">Plugins wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>I also added a new feature for processing bare URLs in a document or selection. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete_bare: true</code> is <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Configuration">set in config</a> or at the top of a file/selection, any URLs that are not self-linked (wrapped in angle brackets) or part of a Markdown link (in parenthesis or after &ldquo;: &ldquo;) will be turned into full Markdown links with page titles as link text. It&rsquo;s perfect for gathering Podcast show notes or blog link posts when you just have a list of URLs.</p>

Here's the summary in Chinese as requested:

SearchLink、浏览器、书签、历史记录、Bug修复

<br /><br />总结:
1. 作者修复了SearchLink的一些Bug。
2. 改进了浏览器搜索工具,现可扫描Arc、Chrome、Firefox、Edge和Safari的书签和浏览历史。
3. 新增了对浏览器多个配置文件的支持,可在所有配置文件中搜索匹配项。
4. 更新了对Arc浏览器的支持,适应其书签文件格式的变化。
5. 推荐Markdown写作者试用SearchLink工具。
6. 发布了SearchLink v2.3.69版本,可生成网络搜索的Markdown链接。 <div>
<p>[SearchLink]: <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">searchlink</a>
[wiki]: https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Searching-Browser-History-And-Bookmarks</p>

<p>As many of these updates seem to, this one started with a bug report from my friend Jay Miller, which caused me to run the test suite on [SearchLink] and discover a few things had broken since I last looked at it. So you get an update.</p>

<p>Aside from fixing bugs that had cropped up, I spent some time on the various browser searching tools. SearchLink can [scan your browser bookmarks and browsing history][wiki] to find the most relevant link for a search term. It works with Arc, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. And it&rsquo;s pretty cool for grabbing links to things you&rsquo;ve already visited or bookmarked.</p>

<p>Now these tools also work with profiles in most browsers, scanning all available profiles for matches. You can&rsquo;t currently specify a single profile, but if a bookmark or history item exists in <em>any</em> of your profiles, it will be found.</p>

<p>I also overhauled the Arc support, as the bookmark file format has changed since I first implemented it, diverging from standard Chromium fare. Should work fine now.</p>

<p>Not a major update, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning. If you write Markdown and haven&rsquo;t tried SearchLink, I highly recommend [taking a look][SearchLink]!</p>

<p>Ok, so you may or may not have heard of my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/howzit/">Howzit</a> project, so I&rsquo;ll begin by recapping. &ldquo;Howzit&rdquo; is a contraction of &ldquo;how does it&rdquo; that allows you to query any project with commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit build</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit deploy</code> and get documentation, as well as automatically execute the necessary steps for a task. I use it almost every day and it has saved me a crazy amount of time over the years, especially in picking up on projects I haven&rsquo;t touched for a while.</p>

<p>The heart of the system is a &ldquo;buildnotes.md&rdquo; file located in the root of your project. This is a Markdown file where you describe each topic, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deploy</code>, listing out any pertinent info. Just stop and think &ldquo;if I come back to this a year from now, what would I need to know?&rdquo; You can include &ldquo;directives&rdquo; that can do things like copy strings to your clipboard or execute code or commands. If you just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit TOPIC</code> it will show you your documentation, and if you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r TOPIC</code>, it will execute any directives in the topic.</p>

<p>Ok, so on to templates. I&rsquo;ve added a lot of functionality to Howzit over the years, but templates have turned out to be my favorite extension. Templates allow you to store reusable tasks in a single file, and then include all of those tasks with a single line at the top of a build notes file.</p>

<p>Everything discussed in this post can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/howzit/wiki">the Howzit wiki</a>, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/howzit/wiki/Templates-and-metadata">Templates and Metadata</a> page.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Templates are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/howzit/templates</code> and are just Markdown files formatted like any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buildnotes.md</code> file. Markdown headers for topics, and they can contain text, lists, tables, and, most importantly for my purposes, directives. They&rsquo;re given a short filename like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git.md</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift.md</code> and saved to the aforementioned directory. Then, in any build notes file, you can add a line at the top like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>template: swift, git</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All of the tasks in those templates are now automatically included in your build notes without any additional documentation. If you frequently use the same tools and structures for projects of the same kind, this greatly reduces the time it takes to document while minimizing errors.</p>

<p>For example, in many of my templates there&rsquo;s a topic called &ldquo;Deploy.&rdquo; This topic contains the steps necessary to publish a project, specific to the type of project it is. I have one for Swift command line tools, one for Ruby gems, one for Sparkle-based Mac apps, etc. The benefit of always naming the topic &ldquo;Deploy&rdquo; is that in <em>any</em> project I can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r deploy</code> and deploy that project without looking anything up or remembering multiple steps<sup id="fnref:steps"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:steps" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You can also specify variables in templates, which are then defined in the individual build notes, allowing for reusable code that&rsquo;s still tailored per-project. For example, for projects that get published to both GitHub and my blog, I have a system that allows me to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/_README.md</code> file containing special syntax that creates different output for my Jekyll-based project page and my GitHub README. In the template for such a project, I have variables for the project name, README source, and changelog location. The README source and changelog variables have default values (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/_README.md</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHANGELOG.md</code>), but the blog project name (which is used to locate the file that generates a project page) varies with each project. So the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project</code> variable is required and Howzit will let me know if I&rsquo;ve included that template and not defined that variable.</p>

<p>As an example, here&rsquo;s my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown.md</code> template, which has actions for spellchecking using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aspell</code>. It allows an optional variable for specifying subdirectories of Markdown files that should be spellchecked, defaulting to just the current folder.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>optional: dirs

# Markdown

### Spellcheck

Check spelling of all Markdown files in git repo.

```run Spellcheck all files
#!/bin/bash
for dir in [%dirs:.]; do
    cd "$dir"
    /Users/ttscoff/scripts/spellcheck.bash
    cd -
done
```

### Spellcheck Modified

Check spelling of Markdown files marked as dirty in git.

```run Spellcheck modified files only
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# Spell check changed Markdown files

staged = `git diff-index --name-status --cached HEAD`.strip.split(/\n/).map {|f| f.sub(/^\s*(A|M)\s*/, '')}
partial = `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no`.strip.split(/\n/).map {|f| f.sub(/^\s*(A|M)\s*/, '')}
changed = staged.concat(partial).sort.uniq
changed.select! {|f| f =~ /(md|markdown)$/ }

home = ENV['HOME']

changed.each do |file|
  system %(aspell -M --lang=en --dont-backup --home-dir=#{home} --personal=#{home}/aspell.txt check "#{file}")
end
```</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or a simpler one: if the project has a Sublime Text project associated with it, I can just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template: sublime</code> and it will offer me this action:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>required: project_file

## Edit Project

@run(subl -p [%project_file].sublime-project)</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I just define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_file: binbundle</code> in my build notes, and then running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r edit</code> will open the project in Sublime. I can create one of these for every possible editor/project type, always using &ldquo;Edit Project&rdquo; as the topic title, and include the appropriate template in each project. Then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r edit</code> will always open the correct project file in the correct editor.</p>

<p>You can get a list of all of your templates by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit --templates</code>. This will show you all templates, what actions they define, and what variables can be (or must be) set for them. You can open any template in your editor by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit --edit-template NAME</code>.</p>

<p>Like I said up top, the longer I use Howzit the more times it saves my butt. It&rsquo;s among the most useful things I&rsquo;ve built and I think every developer should <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/howzit/">give it a shot</a>. If you love it, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/donate/">buy me some coffee</a> or <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/support/">become a supporter</a> to ensure future development of this and all of my other projects.</p>

<title>Binbundle: A gem for saving and restoring gem binaries</title>

<div> 。 <div>
<p>I published a script yesterday for creating a &ldquo;bundle file&rdquo; of all binaries (executables) on your system that rely on Rubygems to install. These aren&rsquo;t covered by Homebrew&rsquo;s bundle command and I wanted easy system restore via my dotfiles setup.</p>

<p>But&hellip; because it deals specifically with gems, I figured why not make it a gem and make it easy to install?</p>

<p>So I present <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/binbundle/">Binbundle</a>, the same script as yesterday, but elaborated on and in gem form.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/binbundle">project page</a> for details on installation and usage. This project combined with <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot">Dotbot</a> makes for a very easy way to restore all of those binaries that Homebrew misses.</p>

<title>Easily save and restore all of your gem executables</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16759288/easily-save-and-restore-gem-executables</link>

<div> 。 <div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle">Homebrew&rsquo;s bundle command</a>. You can save a snapshot of everything you&rsquo;ve installed with Homebrew, and then reinstall the snapshot on a new system.</p>

<p>I also like <a href="https://bundler.io/">Ruby&rsquo;s Bundler</a>, which lets you save all of the gems needed by an application and then install them easily with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>However, I don&rsquo;t like installing Ruby gems with Homebrew, mostly because brew-gem isn&rsquo;t up-to-date and barely functions these days. I install all of my gems with just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install</code>.</p>

<p>Because of this, binaries that are installed by gems aren&rsquo;t included when I do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew bundle install</code>. And Ruby&rsquo;s bundler is project-specific. So I <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/bundle_gem_bins">wrote a script</a> that will save a snapshot of every gem that has a binary installed on your system, and then do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install</code> on all of them when setting up a new system.</p>

<p>I gave it a decent README, so if this is of interest, go check it out. If you use any of my tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code>, you&rsquo;ve probably installed those with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install</code> and they won&rsquo;t be included if you try to restore using Homebrew (or dot files, etc.). So do yourself a favor and create a snapshot!</p>

<p>Please share issues and suggestions using the Issues section of the script&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/bundle_gem_bins">GitHub home</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a new version of <a href="https://marked2app.com/" title="Smarter tools for smarter writers">Marked 2</a> out (available on all channels) that adds some important fixes and a couple of new features.</p>

<h3 id="streaming-preview">Streaming Preview</h3>

<p>First off, I fixed the Streaming Preview for everybody. Every time I fixed it to work with The Archive, I broke it for Drafts, and so on. I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;ve solve the problem for both use cases now. I could be proven wrong, but extensive testing and confirmation from bug testers has me pretty sure. So now you can use the streaming feature of apps like The Archive and Drafts without issue.</p>

<p>I also did some cleanup of the Preferences window while I was in there, but that&rsquo;s purely aesthetic. Someday (probably sooner than later) I&rsquo;ll revamp the whole preference system to use a sidebar for the pane selection like System Settings does on macOS these days.</p>

<h3 id="custom-internal-processors">Custom (Internal) Processors</h3>

<p>The new features I added are around custom processors, kind of. Previously, you could have any processor return just the string &ldquo;NOCUSTOM&rdquo; to skip using the custom processor and resort to using the default internal processor, either MultiMarkdown v5 or Discount (GFM). Now you can also return &ldquo;MULTIMARKDOWN&rdquo; (or MMD) or &ldquo;DISCOUNT&rdquo; (or GFM) to specify exactly which internal processor to use.</p>

<p>The change makes it easy to develop custom processors that can still have different rendering without having to do any of the rendering using command line tools. It also makes it to handle processing using <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/04/25/introducing-the-marked-conductor/" title="Introducing the Marked Conductor">Conductor</a> by simply using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command: echo MMD</code> in a track.</p>

<p>In addition to the Custom Processor return strings, you can also use metadata:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Custom Processor: MultiMarkdown</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or just:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>processor: gfm</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows per-document settings. In Conductor, you can create a preprocessor track that uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addMeta</code> filter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>- condition: phase is pre
  tracks:
    - condition: file name is README.md
      filter: addMeta(processor, gfm)</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or implement it in any way that works for you, even manually or as part of a TextExpander/Blaze snippet.</p>

<p>The update is available now, so go get it! &ldquo;Check for Updates&rdquo; in the direct version, and Setapp and the Mac App Store should update you automatically. Look for version 2.6.39 or newer.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://marked2app.com/" title="Smarter tools for smarter writers">Marked 2</a> for years, you may have noticed you&rsquo;ve never had to pay an upgrade fee for new features. Someday I&rsquo;ll put out a v3 and bill for it, or (heaven forbid) switch to subscriptions, but for now if you want to support development, feel free to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//donate">donate</a> or, better yet, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//support">become a supporter</a>!</p>

<p>By the way, if you&rsquo;re using Conductor make sure you have the latest version (1.0.24 as of this writing), there have been some important bugfixes in the last few days.</p>

<title>Obsidian Callouts in Marked</title>

<div> Obsidian, Marked, Script, Callouts, Styling
<br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了如何在Marked中支持Obsidian的Callouts功能，通过使用特定的脚本和样式表实现。作者提供了详细的操作步骤，包括脚本和样式表的设置以及在Conductor中配置的方法。通过将特定的脚本添加到配置文件中，可以实现在Marked中呈现类似Obsidian的Callouts效果。这种方法可以使Marked用户在不影响正常使用的情况下使用Obsidian的功能。整篇文章重点介绍了如何实现这一功能，并提供了相应的脚本和样式表供读者下载使用。 <div>

              </noscript>
            

<p>I received a request a while back, shortly after my post about <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/05/16/marked-2-and-obsidian/">Marked 2 and Obsidian</a>, asking me to support <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts">Obsidian callouts</a>. I don&rsquo;t remember who made the request, but it got lodged in the back of my head. I had an hour today to knock out a solution.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to incorporate this directly into Marked, I made it a script that can be included in a <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor/">Conductor</a> configuration. Easier, and less intrusive to Marked users who don&rsquo;t care about Obsidian.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts">Obsidian callouts</a> are a block quote-style syntax that looks like:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="gt">&gt; [!note] A note with Markdown content</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; Just *checking*</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; how this **works**... </span>
<span class="gt">&gt; [a link](https://brettterpstra.com)</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>They can be made to fold, nested in each other, have a title only, or a title with content processed as Markdown. Here&rsquo;s how they look in Obsidian:</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/avif" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Callouts in Obsidian" height="530" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/06/callouts-obsidian-800.jpg" title="Callouts in Obsidian" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>Callouts in Obsidian</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>And with the script, here&rsquo;s how they look in Marked:</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/avif" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Callouts in Marked" height="502" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/06/callouts-marked-2.jpg" title="callouts-marked-2.jpg" width="838" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>callouts-marked-2.jpg</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>The output is just nested divs with classes, so a separate stylesheet is required to make them look correct. This stylesheet is injected by Conductor as well, and adapts pretty well to any Style in Marked. For example, here it is with the Manuscript style:</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/avif" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Callouts in Manuscript" height="500" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/06/callouts-manuscript.jpg" title="Callouts in Manuscript" width="860" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>Callouts in Manuscript</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>I separated the script from the main Obsidian script so that, should you want to, you can run it on any content and make use of the Obsidian callout syntax irrespective of other syntax.</p>

<p>The script is in my <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/tree/main">Conductor example config</a>, along with the stylesheet document. You can see in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/blob/main/tracks.yaml#L17">tracks.yaml</a> file that the script and injection are defined as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">tracks</span><span class="pi">:</span>

<p>The files you need are <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/blob/main/scripts/obsidian-callouts">the script</a> (placed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/conductor/scripts/</code>) and <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/blob/main/files/callouts.html">the style</a> (placed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/conductor/files/</code>). Both of these are included if you just clone the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/tree/main">example config repo</a>. Then include a sequence like above for any given condition to start handling Obsidian callout syntax. This works best as a Preprocessor, but should still function fine as part of a Processor if you&rsquo;re also handling the Markdown conversion in a script.</p>

<title>Markdown Lipsum v2</title>

<div> API options, paragraphs, elements, parameters, control
API 2版本做出了变动，现在用户可以指定段落数量和包含元素。用户可以使用不同的路径来确定段落长度和数量，还可以控制包含的元素。在路径中添加参数可以实现这些功能。这样用户可以根据自己的需求定制Markdown文档。同时，作者提到如果没有给出参数，默认输出5段中等长度的文本，并提供了详细的路径参数说明。通过API 2，用户可以更自由地生成想要的文档内容。文章中还提到，作者对BrettTerpstra.com的支持来自读者，鼓励点赞或分享。 <div>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s been <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//2024/06/14/a-markdown-lorem-ipsum-api/">less than a week</a> since v1, but I made some major changes to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//md-lipsum/">md-lipsum</a> that warrant a version 2.</p>

<p>Basically, I incorporated all of the API options from <a href="https://loripsum.net/">Loripsum.net</a>, meaning you can now specify how many paragraphs and what elements are included. You can still get a full Markdown document with all elements using <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/api/2/all">https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/api/2/all</a>. You can include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/short</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/medium</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/long</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/verylong</code> in the path to determine paragraph length (can be shortened to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vl</code>), and/or a number to determine the number of paragraphs. More paragraphs means more header levels, too. Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>curl 'https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/api/2/all/10/m'</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>If no parameters are given, e.g. the path is just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/2</code>, then all elements will be output with 5 paragraphs of medium length.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also control exactly what elements are included using additional path parameters. These are detailed on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//md-lipsum/">project page</a>.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

If you try them out and run into issues, let me know.</p>

<p>This set includes a couple of snippets for inserting placeholder images into HTML/Markdown documents, which I use pretty frequently when designing.

<div> Markdown Lorem Ipsum, API, Text Blaze, MD-Lipsum, BrettTerpstra.com
<br />
关于构建新的Markdown Lorem Ipsum API用于生成Markdown Lorem Ipsum。作者解释了构建API的原因，提及使用Text Blaze应用以及制作脚本片段的需求。介绍了MD-Lipsum的用途和如何使用API，包括从命令行和Text Blaze使用的示例。提供了对应的curl命令和Text Blaze代码。文中还介绍了网站支持的方式和版权声明。
<br /><br />总结:文章介绍了构建Markdown Lorem Ipsum API的目的，以及如何使用该API生成Markdown Lorem Ipsum。提供了命令行和Text Blaze使用示例，同时提及网站支持方式和版权声明。 <div>
<p>I built a new little API for you. It generates Markdown Lorem Ipsum. First, a little background.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned elsewhere, I&rsquo;ve been playing with <a href="https://blaze.today/">Text Blaze</a>, a cool new app that might eventually replace TextExpander for me. One of the major things missing from Text Blaze, though, is script snippets, which I make use of a lot in TextExpander. What it does offer, though, is a command for fetching a REST API and processing the result. A lot of my script snippets are doing just that, so those are actually more convenient to build in Text Blaze. For the ones that need extra handling, I&rsquo;ve just been creating web endpoints that run my scripts for me.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>When you go to the <a href="https://blaze.today/">Text Blaze home page</a> it looks like it&rsquo;s just a Chrome extension. You have to go all the way to the bottom of the page to find the Mac app (beta).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One such snippet I wanted back was my random Markdown generator, which I use frequently to test out styles for things like <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a>, <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a>, or <a href="https://multimarkdown.com/composer4/">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>. There&rsquo;s an existing API called <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/">Lorem Markdownum</a>, but it doesn&rsquo;t generate enough of the syntax consistently to be good for testing themes. So I built my own.</p>

<h3 id="md-lipsum">MD-Lipsum</h3>

<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/">&ldquo;MD-Lipsum&rdquo;</a> uses <a href="https://loripsum.net/">Loripsum.net</a> to generate a full set of HTML markup with random text, and then converts that HTML to basic Markdown. No tables, unfortunately, but it outputs a complete set of standard Markdown elements, including bold/italics, ordered and unordered lists, headers, block quotes, code blocks (fenced), and definition lists (MultiMarkdown syntax).</p>

<h4 id="usage">Usage</h4>

<p>To use the API, just point to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/api/1</code>. You can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/long</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/short</code> but it has minimal effect (a shortcoming of the loripsum.net API, I think). It just returns plain text, much like the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/test">TitleCase API</a> I made a while back.</p>

<p>You can use it from the command line like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>curl 'https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/api/1'</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To use it in Text Blaze, you&rsquo;d want a snippet like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{urlload: https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/api/1; done=(res) -&gt; ["response": res]; headers=; body=; method=GET}{=response}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little page <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/">here</a> but it just tells you what&rsquo;s in this post!</p>

<title>Adding custom search shortcuts in Firefox</title>

<div> firefox, custom search, keyword, bookmark, search

总结：<br /><br />本文介绍了在Firefox浏览器中如何添加自定义搜索快捷方式，通过设置关键词和书签来实现在浏览器地址栏中快速搜索任意网站。用户只需在地址栏输入设置的关键词加上搜索词即可直接加载搜索结果页面，避免繁琐的进入网站、点击搜索以及输入搜索词的步骤。方法包括在目标网站进行搜索、添加书签、编辑书签URL以及设置关键词等步骤。这种自定义搜索方式适用于多数浏览器，方便用户快速获取所需信息。 <div>
<p>This might not be news to most people, but I thought I&rsquo;d point it out for any Firefox users that don&rsquo;t know about it: you can add a custom search shortcut for any site, allowing you to use a short keyword followed by search terms and execute the search without going to the site, clicking search, and entering terms.</p>

<p>To add a custom search:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the site you want to search and use its search field to run any search.</li>
  <li>On the results page, add a bookmark. You can edit the bookmark title to a generic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;SITE NAME&gt; search</code> in this step or in step 4.</li>
  <li>Open up the Bookmarks sidebar (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-B"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">B</kbd></span>) (or open the Bookmarks manager with <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-Command-O"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">O</kbd></span>) and locate the new bookmark. Right click it and choose <strong>Edit Bookmark</strong>.</li>
  <li>Change the search term in the URL to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s</code>. E.g., if you searched for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frog</code>, find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frog</code> in the URL and replace it.</li>
  <li>Add a short &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; and edit the title to a generic &ldquo;X Search&rdquo; if you didn&rsquo;t already. The keyword is the short text you&rsquo;ll use to access the search. It can be as short as one character.</li>
  <li>Save the edit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can just focus the URL bar (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-L"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">L</kbd></span>), type the keyword followed by a space and whatever search terms you want to use. The search page will be loaded directly with the results!</p>

<p>Hope that&rsquo;s useful to some people. The same thing can be done in most browsers, I just happen to be using mostly Firefox these days. Feel free to add tips for your browser of choice in the comments.</p>

<title>Man, I should have started Conductor with filters</title>

<div> YAML文件, 配置，插入TOC, 文件插入, 代码块插入<br />
<br />
总结:<br />
本文介绍了如何通过在YAML配置文件中添加一些新的过滤器来方便地进行配置，如插入表格目录、在内容开头或结尾插入文件、插入原始HTML或代码块等。通过这些过滤器，可以实现在文档中插入目录、文件、原始HTML或代码块的功能。插入的文件可以是绝对路径，也可以存储在指定路径并以文件名引用。这些过滤器使得通常需要使用脚本来完成的任务变得简单，只需一行配置即可。适用于生成PDF、HTML或Markdown文档。最后介绍了如何使用新的insertScript()过滤器添加Mermaid或自定义的MathJax实现。文章提供了更多详细信息。 <div>
<p>I added a few more (obvious) <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/05/24/conductor-filters-simplify-basic-operations/">filters</a> to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">Conductor</a> this morning. I really should have started here, it makes configuration so convenient and alleviates the need for about 50% of what you would do with scripting. Now you can do it all from one YAML file.</p>

<p>The new filters are:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertTOC(max, after)</code></td>
      <td>insert TOC (max=max levels, after=start, *h1, or h2)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepend/appendFile(path)</code></td>
      <td>insert a file as Markdown at beginning or end of content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepend/appendRaw(path)</code></td>
      <td>insert a file as raw HTML at beginning or end of content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepend/appendCode(path)</code></td>
      <td>insert a file as a code block at beginning or end of content</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These allow you to insert a table of contents and append or prepend files, raw HTML, or code blocks.</p>

<p>Inserted files can be absolute paths or you can store templates in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/conductor/files</code> and just reference them by filename. Perfect for adding things like bios and disclaimers to your documents before outputing them (as PDF, HTML, or even as a new Markdown document).</p>

<p>The table of contents can be inserted at the top (&ldquo;start&rdquo; or &ldquo;top&rdquo;) or after the first h1 or h2 in the document.</p>

<p>If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertTOC(3, h1)</code> after an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertTitle</code> in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code>, you&rsquo;d get a title inserted from metadata first, then a TOC inserted after it. (Then use the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertScript()</code> filter to add Mermaid or a custom MathJax implementation. Sky&rsquo;s the limit, kind of.)</p>

<p>These filters make some of the more basic tasks you&rsquo;d usually perform with a Custom Processor script as easy as one line in a config file.</p>

<div> insertScript, insertTitle, JavaScript, config, BrettTerpstra

JavaScript中新增了insertScript过滤器，可以插入JS脚本；insertTitle过滤器可提取标题并插入内容中。通过配置文件实现自动化操作，支持自定义路径和脚本。提高了使用便捷性和灵活性，增强了功能性。文章介绍了这些新增功能，并希望读者提供更多有用建议。总结:JavaScript功能扩展，配置文件实现自动化操作，提高使用便捷性和灵活性。 <div>
<p>So yesterday I announced a new feature in <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor/">Conductor</a> called <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/05/24/conductor-filters-simplify-basic-operations/">Filters</a>. Little built-in commands for performing simple tasks without having to write whole scripts for them. In the process of writing the feature, I forgot what might be the most useful function of all: injecting JavaScripts.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertScript(path)</code> as a filter. You can give it a full path to a JavaScript file, or you can create a directory at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/conductor/javascript</code>, add the file there, and then just reference it by name like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter: insertScript(mermaid)</code> (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.js</code> is added automatically if needed). You can insert multiple scripts at once by separating the paths with commas, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertScript(blog,mermaid)</code>.</p>

<p>I also added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertTitle</code> filter that will attempt to pull a title out of metadata (YAML or MMD), and failing that use the filename, converting a slug into a titlecased title (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2024-05-24-my-blog-post.md</code> becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My Blog Post</code>), and insert it as an H1 at the beginning of the content (after any front matter/metadata).</p>

<p>An example config for using this (assuming the scripts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog.js</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mermaid.js</code> exist in the above directory) would look like:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">tracks</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">condition</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">phase is pre</span>
    <span class="na">tracks</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Blog post preprocess</span>
      <span class="na">condition</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">path contains _post AND has yaml</span>
      <span class="na">sequence</span><span class="pi">:</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">filter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">setStyle(BrettTerpstra.com)</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">filter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">addTitle</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">filter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">insertScript(blog,mermaid)</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>That config would require no scripting at all. The style would be set, an h1 title would be added, and two scripts would be injected before running through the default Marked processor.</p>

<p>If you think of any more that would be useful, please let me know!</p>

<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/04/25/introducing-the-marked-conductor/" title="Introducing the Marked Conductor">Last month</a> I released <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">Conductor</a>, a tool for handling multiple Custom Processors in <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a>. It allows you to use natural language conditions to determine which command or script to run, either as preprocessor or processor for Marked. But I found a lot of <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/tree/main">my scripts</a> were just injecting metadata or performing other simple actions, so I added a new feature to Conductor called Filters. Filters are just shortcuts to avoid having to write simple (often 3 or 4 line) scripts.</p>

<p>Like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command:</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script:</code> actions, you can now just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter: filterName(parameters)</code> to do things like setting a Marked Style, injecting or stripping metadata (YAML/MMD aware), or doing search and replaces on the content. These can be run in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence:</code> to combine multiple filters.</p>

<h3 id="available-filters">Available Filters</h3>

<p>The available filters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addMeta(key, value)</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMeta(key, value)</code> &ndash; adds or updates a meta key, aware of YAML and MMD</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stripMeta</code> &ndash; strips all metadata (YAML or MMD) from the content</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stripMeta(key)</code> &ndash; removes a specific key (YAML or MMD)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setStyle(name)</code> &ndash; sets the Marked preview style to a preconfigured Style name</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replace(search, replace)</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replaceAll(search, replace)</code> &ndash; performs a search and replace (global with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replaceAll</code>).
    <ul>
      <li>If <em>search</em> is surrounded with forward slashes followed by optional flags (<em>i</em> for case-insensitive, <em>m</em> to make dot match newlines), e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/contribut(ing)?/i</code>, it will be interpreted as a regular expression. The <em>replace</em> value can include numeric capture groups, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Follow$2</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Update to the latest version using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install marked-conductor</code> (may vary depending on how you installed it originally) to get the new features, see the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">project page</a> for details, and check out my <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/tree/main">config</a> to see examples.</p>

<p>If there are any simple procedures you&rsquo;re currently using scripts to handle that aren&rsquo;t covered by these, please let me know in the comments what filters you&rsquo;d like to see added!</p>

<h3 id="also-easier-testing">Also, easier testing</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s now a file in the repo called <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/marked-conductor/blob/main/test.sh"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test.sh</code></a> that makes it way easier to test configurations from the command line. Just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test.sh FILENAME</code> to process a file as if it were being opened in Marked. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-o err</code> to output only the STDERR response, which will show which conditions are being matched, and you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> to define the phase as either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pre</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pro</code> to run as Preprocessor or Processor, respectively.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" title="Obsidian-Sharpen your thinking">Obsidian</a> is really cool. It&rsquo;s a Markdown-based note system that has a ton of cool features, and even more with its healthy plugin community.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see Obsidian as direct competition for <a href="https://nvultra.com/" title="nvUltra-Searchable, portable, MultiMarkdown notes">nvUltra</a><sup id="fnref:beta"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:beta" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, where the main focus is rapid note-taking and full text search, which nvUltra does a superior job of. I actually open my main nvUltra Notebook in Obsidian as a Vault (both of which are just folders on your drive) and love the ease of using both apps together.</p>

<p>Lee Garrett and Mike Schmitz have done some great Obsidian tutorials over at <a href="https://screencastsonline.com/members/aff/go/bterpstra">ScreenCastsOnline</a>. Check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.screencastsonline.com/tutorials/productivity/obsidian-basics?ref=bterpstra">Obsidian Basics</a> from Lee, giving a full tutorial for getting started with Obsidian</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.screencastsonline.com/tutorials/productivity/obsidian-plugins-starter-kit?ref=bterpstra">Obsidian Plugins Starter Kit</a> from Mike, offering an overview of some great core and community plugins, with tips that will also serve you well for getting used to using plugins in general</li>
</ul>

<p>(I have an affiliate arrangement with SCO that gives me a little income if you subscribe. They make amazing videos so I&rsquo;m very happy to partner with them!)</p>

<h3 id="integrating-with-marked-2">Integrating with Marked 2</h3>

<p>The point of this post is not to get you to use Obsidian. It&rsquo;s about integrating <a href="https://marked2app.com/" title="Smarter tools for smarter writers">Marked 2</a> with Obsidian for those who already use it. Obsidian plugins offer some great Markdown preview features, but lack all of the writing and customization tools that Marked offers.</p>

<p>Marked works perfectly with Obsidian. You just have to open the current note in Marked and changes show up with about a two-second delay in Marked as you edit (based on the rate that Obsidian autosaves). You can also open your entire Vault folder in Marked and it will always show you the note you&rsquo;re currently editing. It&rsquo;s just a bit of a pain to get these to Marked without revealing in Finder and dragging. So I made <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/Marked2-obsidian" title="ttscoff/Marked2-obsidian">a plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually I&rsquo;d like to have this plugin available in Obsidian&rsquo;s Community Plugins, but the process of getting it accepted has been slow. If and when it is eventually merged, I&rsquo;ll update these instructions as the process will become much easier. In the meantime, you&rsquo;ll need to do a manual install:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.obsidian/plugins</code> folder in your Vault. The easiest way to get there is to open Obsidian Preferences, navigate to Community Plugins, then click the folder icon next to Installed Plugins.</p>

    
           <noscript class="loading-lazy">
             <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source />
             <img alt="browse-obsidian-plugins-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="206" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/05/browse-obsidian-plugins-800.jpg" title="browse-obsidian-plugins-800.jpg" width="800" />
           </noscript>
         
  </li>
  <li>Create a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Marked-obsidian</code> in the plugins folder.</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/Marked2-obsidian/releases/latest">the latest release</a> of the Marked 2 plugin and download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.js</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> files to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.obsidian/plugins/Marked-obsidian</code> folder.</li>
  <li>Return to Obsidian Preferences -&gt; Community Plugins and you should now see the Marked plugin available. Enable it by clicking the slider.</li>
</ol>

<p>This gives you a sidebar button for opening the current note in Marked (which can be &ldquo;Marked blue&rdquo; or neutral to fit your theme), as well as two commands in the palette: &ldquo;Open note in Marked&rdquo; and &ldquo;Open vault in Marked.&rdquo;</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="obsidian-commands-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="268" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/obsidian-commands-800.jpg" title="obsidian-commands-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<h3 id="handling-obsidian-syntax">Handling Obsidian Syntax</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re regularly opening Obsidian files in Marked, you might want to add a Custom Preprocessor for handling general Obsidian markup:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/voostindie/obsidian-md-filter">this one</a> from voostinidie that does things like stripping YAML, stripping emojis, and converting wiki links to plain text. It has the nice benefit of replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![[file include]]</code> syntax with IA block syntax, which Marked will render. I may eventually add the Obsidian formatting as a valid option for file includes in Marked by default, based on interest. I had a PR accepted to this repo that adds some additional config options for replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[wiki links]]</code> and other Obsidian syntax with links back to the note/header in Obsidian. See the README for configuration details. <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/obsidian-md-filter">My own fork</a> will always have the latest changes.</li>
  <li>This <a href="https://gist.github.com/radekkozak/9b07af0ff3c90d4dc51d3a4ab41b5b8f?permalink_comment_id=3740329">much simpler one</a> from radekkozak just handles wiki links, and converts them to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obsidian://</code> links for you, so clicking a link in Marked will open the linked note in Obsidian.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>If you want to be able to render Obsidian notes differently from your usual documents in Marked, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor/" title="Introducing the Marked Conductor">Conductor</a> is the perfect solution. You can see my own rules for handling Obsidian notes in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/">sample config</a> I provide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my first Obsidian plugin, and I&rsquo;m not a regular Obsidian user (yet), so I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to really dig into creating more in the future. But this one serves its purpose well and I think a lot of people will find it handy.</p>

<p>By the way, one handy feature of Obsidian is <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Obsidian Sync</a>, which is a paid add-on. But never fear, there&rsquo;s a giveaway coming up <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">later this year</a> that will get you a free year. <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/subscribe/">Sign up for the newsletter</a> to stay in the loop on all of the sweet giveaways I have lined up.</p>

<div> Mind map, WriteMapper, writing, features, summary
<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了作者使用思维导图进行长篇写作的方式，提到了他习惯使用的iThoughts和新尝试的WriteMapper应用。WriteMapper针对写作提供了专门设计的功能，包括编辑器、文档视图和键盘快捷键等特点。编辑器提供了标准的文本编辑功能，但缺少Markdown视图。文档视图方便查看整个文档，可以实时更新修改。键盘快捷键丰富，可以在偏好设置中自定义。除此之外，WriteMapper还具有导出和任务管理等功能，对开发者也友好。总的来说，WriteMapper是一款适合写作的工具，虽然价格较高，但功能齐全，易于移植，作者认为物有所值。 <div>

<p>One of the major things I use mind maps for is developing longer-form writing. I do best spitting out all of my ideas for topics and chapters into a mind map, then editing the nodes into chapters and paragraphs. I’ve always done this with iThoughts, which has great keyboard shortcuts for navigating and switching between node and notes panels. Then I would view the piece as it came together using <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked’s</a> iThoughts integration, and when it was in a mostly gelled state, I would export Markdown and continue editing in <a href="https://multimarkdown.com/" title="MultiMarkdown Software">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>.</p>

<p>I’m going to continue using iThoughts for as long as it survives (in case you missed it, it was announced recently that support and development has been discontinued). As I mentioned in <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/04/28/life-after-ithoughts/">a previous post</a>, I’m going to trust <a href="https://www.mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> to fill in the gap left behind when the time comes. But for writing, I’ve been playing with a new app called WriteMapper (which I mentioned previously in <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/12/11/web-excursions-for-december-11-2023/">a Web Excursions post</a>).</p>

<h3 id="the-writemapper-way">The WriteMapper way</h3>

<p>WriteMapper is specifically designed for the above use case. It&rsquo;s developed by a solo indie dev (Guan), who&rsquo;s built it out into a very polished app.</p>

<p>Writing in mind map form makes it really easy to organize (and reorganize) content as you write, and to pop between topics as inspiration hits. You can write very specific pieces in each node, and easily arrange them in a way that makes sense, without having to plan far in advance. Sure, you can do the same thing with copy/paste in your editor, but I work best with the map layout.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a side note, MultiMarkdown Composer has a great feature where you can open the Table of Contents view and drag sections around (based on headers) to reorganize the document. It reminds me of an old iOS app called Paragraphs, which I loved but I don’t think it stood the test of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post in WriteMapper right now, and I&rsquo;m finding it very enjoyable.</p>

              </noscript>
            

<h3 id="writemapper-features">WriteMapper features</h3>

<h4 id="the-editor">The Editor</h4>

<p>WriteMapper has a great editor built in. It&rsquo;s a much more polished editing experience than writing in iThoughts was. It gives you all your standard shortcuts for bold, italics, and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span> for links, and it’s easy to add headlines, though most of those will be added using the node titles.</p>

<p>The editor is your basic plain text editor with a rich text overlay, a la IA Writer or to some extent Ulysses, but closer to a WYSYWIG editor in a platform like WordPress. It&rsquo;s slick and comfortable to work in, though you can&rsquo;t see a Markdown view, which I miss from some Markdown-based editors. The underlying format for the document is HTML, so you don&rsquo;t have a lot of more &ldquo;word processor&rdquo; type features available, but for my own writing, that&rsquo;s irrelevant. Anything I need to do that I can&rsquo;t in plain text is done with plugins and extensions to my publishing platforms. You don&rsquo;t get to choose your font for editing, which might bug some people.</p>

<p>As far as Markdown compatibility goes, it will convert some Markdown to the rich text view. Double asterisks will become bold, single will become italic, and inline links will work. <em>However,</em> if you try to hit undo after manually entering Markdown syntax, things can get weird. You&rsquo;re best off using the built-in shortcuts for these features. Pasting Markdown doesn&rsquo;t seem to get parsed, either.</p>

<p>If you select multiple lines and hit the bullet list shortcut, it will convert the lines into a bullet list. Hitting the shortcut again (or on any bulleted list) will remove the bullets. Hitting the shortcut for a numbered list behaves the same way, and will convert a bullet list to a numbered list.</p>

<p>You can insert images from file or URL. Most of the time I&rsquo;m writing for a Jekyll system, where I have my own custom plugins for image handling, so I can just paste in my Liquid code for an image and WriteMapper doesn&rsquo;t mess with it.</p>

<p>Autosave seems to be non-standard (to macOS). WriteMapper&rsquo;s implementation can have a frequency set as often as one minute, but if you experience a crash (which I haven&rsquo;t) you would lose everything up to the last auto save.</p>

<p>WriteMapper also implements spellchecking and autocorrect, and both of those seem to use standard macOS implementation. And for anything spell check chokes on, note that there&rsquo;s an Add to Dictionary option in the right click menu, as opposed to the more standard &ldquo;Learn spelling&rdquo; option.</p>

<h4 id="document-view">Document View</h4>

<p>An essential feature of WriteMapper is the Document View. While you can traverse and edit your document as a mind map, you can also open Document View and edit it all as one piece. You can&rsquo;t rearrange anything in Document View, though — for that you have to switch back to a map view.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="writemapper-document-view.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="804" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/05/writemapper-document-view.jpg" title="writemapper-document-view.jpg" width="1305" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>Document View pretty much alleviates my need for Marked integration, as I can easily see my map formatted as a document, in map order, with a quick press of <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-4"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">4</kbd></span> (or whatever you customize the shortcut to). You can edit in Document view just like in a node view, and it has an outline view on the side for navigation. You can even open the Document View in another window and see changes you make to nodes appear in the full document on save, just like using it with Marked.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="writemapper-dual-view-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="429" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/05/writemapper-dual-view-800.jpg" title="writemapper-dual-view-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<h4 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>

<p>WriteMapper has plenty of keyboard shortcuts, but they’re very non-standard for a mind map app. You can, however, easily change the shortcuts in Preferences, and I now have it working more predictably (like Tab to add a child node). <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-E"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">E</kbd></span> pops you right into the editor for the selected node, and when you’re done editing, Escape will get you back to the map.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, in the document editor you have your standard word processor key combinations available, such as <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-I"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">I</kbd></span> and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-B"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">B</kbd></span>. There are also shortcuts for block quotes, horizontal rules, and lists.</p>

<p>While they don&rsquo;t show up in the Insert menu, there are also keyboard shortcuts for inline code and code blocks, and code blocks can be highlighted if you check the option in Preferences. Inserting Markdown syntax for these also works (three backticks works, indenting doesn&rsquo;t).</p>

<h4 id="other-features">Other Features</h4>

<p>Map views can be linear, nested, or sprawl, which is more of a traditional mind map layout.</p>

<p>WriteMapper can export as Markdown or OPML, but can also export straight to HTML, Word, RTF, and other formats.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For developers, the file format is a basic JSON file with an array of nodes in document order, with the content stored as HTML, so integrating this with Marked will be simple, and recovering old documents if WriteMapper ever stops working will be entirely feasible. Which are important considerations to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The app can show you your total word count, character count, and reading time as you edit, and each node can be set to display its own word count. You can also set nodes to tasks and check them off as you complete them.</p>

<p>You can also open the same document in multiple windows for side-by-side editing of different chapters. You can&rsquo;t have multiple documents open in tabs, as far as I can tell, but if I need two documents open at once, I need them both visible anyway for copying between the two.</p>

<p>WriteMapper also supposedly has some AI features, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten it to accept my OpenAI key yet and haven&rsquo;t spent much time figuring that out. I&rsquo;ll do my own writing for now.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>

<p>In summary, WriteMapper is a great tool for writing. A few quirks, but fully capable for my own needs. The export options are robust, and the document format is standard enough to be easily portable. And being able to construct a piece in a mind map is exactly the way I want to write. WriteMapper isn&rsquo;t cheap &mdash; a single license is US $89. I think it might be more comfortable in the $40-50 range, but I consider it money well spent and I&rsquo;m happy to support continued development.</p>

              </noscript>
            
<p>I&rsquo;ve made some important fixes and handy improvements to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">Marked Conductor</a> since it was <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/04/25/introducing-the-marked-conductor/">first published</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made my own config available as an example. Not all of the scripts are polished, but it&rsquo;s complete enough to show how I&rsquo;m using it. I still need to finish breaking my Jekyll preprocessor script into more manageable chunks, which is complicated because every little method has conditionals, but that&rsquo;s coming. In the meantime, you can find my <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/conductor-config/tree/main">work in progress here</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the rundown.</p>

<h3 id="titles-and-stderr-output">Titles and STDERR Output</h3>

<p>Conductor now outputs more helpful information to STDERR, which you can view in Marked using Help-&gt;Show Custom Processor Log. It will display a list of conditions met for the current document, along with any errors. You can also now add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> key to any track, and it will be used in the STDERR output instead of the full condition, which is handy for long conditions with lots of booleans. So instead of:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Condition met: tree contains .obsidian AND (extension is md OR extension is markdown)</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can just get:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Condition  met: Obsidian Document</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="multiple-scripts">Multiple scripts</h3>

<p>Conductor can now run multiple scripts in sequence. There are two ways to do this.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instead of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command</code>, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code>. Then in an array list, you can define a series of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- script: xxx</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- command: xxx</code> type lines and they&rsquo;ll be run in order, with the output of one being passed to the next, getting the final output from the last script/command in the list.</li>
  <li>You can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue: true</code> to any track or block. Normally, Conductor stops processing when a condition is met. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue: true</code>, it will continue matching conditions after processing the one with the key, again passing the output of each one to the next. This allows you to, for example, run a preprocessor on a narrow selection of documents, and then run those through a more generalized processor that catches more documents than the narrow selection does.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the full changelog since release.</p>

<h4 id="new">NEW</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Test for pandoc metadata (%%) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is pandoc</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is not pandoc</code></li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence:</code> key to allow running a series of scripts/commands, each piping to the next</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue: true</code> for tracks to allow processing to continue after a script/command is successful</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filename</code> key for comparing to just filename (instead of full path)</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is a</code> tests for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">number</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">integer</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code></li>
  <li>Tracks in YAML config can have a title key that will be shown in STDERR &lsquo;Conditions met:&rsquo; output</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">does not contain</code> handling for string and metadata comparisons</li>
  <li>Added test for MMD metadata, either for presence of meta or for specific keys or key values</li>
  <li>Allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has yaml</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has meta</code> (MultiMarkdown) as conditions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="improved">IMPROVED</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Return NOCUSTOM if changes are not made by scripts/commands, even though condition was matched</li>
  <li>Use YAML.load instead of .safe_load to allow more flexibility</li>

<title>Life after iThoughts</title>

<div> MindNode, iThoughts, sunsetting, Obsidian, Curio
<br />
总结:<br />
iThoughts宣布即将停用，作者转向使用MindNode。MindNode拥有精美界面、活跃开发、支持Mac和iOS版本，能够打开iThoughts文件，导入Markdown文件，生成任务列表等功能。此外，Obsidian插件也能提供一定的思维导图功能，但相比MindNode功能有限。值得注意的是Curio内置的思维导图也是不错的选择。 <div>

<p>So a lot of us are wondering what to do now that Toketaware has announced the sunsetting of the iThoughts mind mapping app for Mac and iOS. It&rsquo;s very sad to see it go, but I expect the current version to continue working for a few years to come. That said, I tend to favor software that has at least somewhat of a future. So I&rsquo;ve been testing the waters with some other contenders. The short story is I&rsquo;m moving over to <a href="https://www.mindnode.com/" title="MindNode:Mind Map &amp; Brainstorm Ideas">MindNode</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-mindnode">Why MindNode?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always appreciated MindNode (and even added support for it to Marked), but there were some things that made me prefer iThoughts over MindNode. After testing the latest version of MindNode, I can no longer remember what those things were. Probably the filtering and advanced searching in iThoughts, but for 90% of my mind map purposes, it looks like MindNode will do just fine. I think the last time I made the comparison, MindNode was lacking some of the features it has these days.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going into nearly the depth that Allison Sheridan did over on Podfeet with her <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2024/03/ithoughts-replacement/">mind map comparison</a>, but I&rsquo;ll list some of the pros of MindNode for my purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Looks great</li>
  <li>Actively developed</li>
  <li>Mac and iOS versions</li>
  <li>Opens iThoughts (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.itmz</code>) files, so I don&rsquo;t have to fret about losing old mind maps</li>
  <li>Imports Markdown files</li>
  <li>Can create tasks from nodes (can&rsquo;t do much with them other than check them off, but it&rsquo;s handy for packing lists)</li>
  <li>Exports Markdown and OPML, among other formats</li>
  <li>Works with Marked (File-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Preview in Marked)</li>
  <li>Good keyboard navigation with some customization options</li>
  <li>Quick entry from tool bar</li>
  <li>It&rsquo;s on Setapp</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an Obsidian user, there are some mind mapping plugins available. The <a href="https://github.com/MarkMindCkm/obsidian-enhancing-mindmap">&ldquo;Enhancing Mind Maps&rdquo;</a> plugin is a decent option if you&rsquo;re in Obsidian all the time anyway:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built into obsidian</li>
  <li>Basic keyboard navigation</li>
  <li>Transparent layer over plain Markdown files, easily portable and future-proof</li>
  <li>Works great with Marked using the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/obsidian-md-filter">obsidian-md-filter</a> processor (via <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">Conductor!</a>), and you can easily connect the two with <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/Marked2-obsidian">my plugin</a> (which is still waiting for acceptance into the Community Plugins&hellip;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lacks a <em>ton</em> of features compared to MindNode</li>
</ul>

<p>I would also point out that the mind mapping built into <a href="https://www.zengobi.com/curio/">Curio</a> is pretty good, and has the benefit of fitting into the crazy cool integrations that Curio provides, linking to other notes and objects, and fitting into an overall project management system.</p>

<title>Introducing the Marked Conductor</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16664804/introducing-the-marked-conductor</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16664804/introducing-the-marked-conductor</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Marked, Conductor, YAML configuration, custom processors, conditional running <br />
<br />总结: 该篇文章介绍了最新的副产品——Marked，并详细描述了其背景和功能。Marked提供了使用Markdown（和预处理器）的选项，允许您在配置文件中使用自定义命令将其转换为HTML。借助Conductor，用户可以轻松设置自定义处理器，并根据条件在不同的讨论中执行不同的脚本或命令。Conductor支持各种条件匹配方式，如YAML frontmatter键匹配、内容匹配、文件或目录存在性检测等。该项目将受到使用Marked的Custom Processors的人的极大兴趣，无论您是一个熟练的脚本编写者还是只是想在不同文档中运行不同处理器的人，Conductor都能够轻松实现条件运行。待Obsidian插件被接受进入Community Plugins后，作者还将发布一篇关于如何在Obsidian中使用Marked的文章。 <div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completed my latest side project, the Marked <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">Conductor</a>. Here&rsquo;s the backstory:</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="conductor.png" class="alignright" height="256" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/conductor.png" title="conductor.png" width="256" />
              </noscript>
            
<p><a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked 2</a> offers the option to use <a href="https://marked2app.com/help/Custom_Processor">Custom Processors</a> (and Preprocessors) which allow you use Markdown (and other) flavors with your own commands to convert them to HTML. This is commonly used for processing with Pandoc. Personally, I use it to process my blog posts (and Bunch and other Jekyll help docs) with Kramdown and a bunch of special handlers for previewing the custom Liquid tags and plugins I&rsquo;ve built, process TaskPaper files with their own functions, and process everything else with Marked&rsquo;s built-in processors. In those scripts, you can use environment variables like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$MARKED_EXT</code> (the file&rsquo;s extension) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$MARKED_ORIGIN</code> (the file&rsquo;s path) to fork the script and process differently based on things like file type or location. But my custom processor script was getting unwieldy with all of the conditions I was creating, and for people with limited scripting knowledge, it meant having to turn custom processors on and off based on the needs for the current document.</p>

<p>Enter Conductor. It&rsquo;s a command line utility that can be set as the custom processor in Marked. It reads from a YAML configuration file where conditions are written in natural language (e.g. tree contains .obsidian) and trigger either a script or a command. Conditions can be booleans (extension is md AND tree contains .obsidian) or they can be nested infinitely to create forked &ldquo;tracks&rdquo; for handling any type of document. It offers ways of matching YAML frontmatter keys, matching content with strings or regular expressions, detecting whether a file or directory exists anywhere in the parent folders of the file, and more.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into all of the features in this post, but they&rsquo;re all detailed on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor">project page</a>. The entire project is available <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/marked-conductor">on GitHub</a>, but it&rsquo;s published as a gem, so installation is as easy as running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install marked-conductor</code>. Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conductor</code> once from the command line will build out all of the configuration directories and files. Then it&rsquo;s just a matter of setting up your own tracks and actions.</p>

<p>I think this project will be of great interest to anyone using Custom Processors in Marked. Whether you&rsquo;re an avid scripter who&rsquo;s extended it in interesting ways, or just someone who might want Pandoc for documents in your &ldquo;Work&rdquo; folder, but Kramdown for documents in your &ldquo;Blogging&rdquo; folder, this project makes it very easy to run Custom Processors conditionally.</p>

<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m waiting on my Obsidian plugin for Marked to be accepted into the Community Plugins. Once that happens, I have a post all about using Marked with Obsidian that I think Obsidian users will love. Stay tuned.</p>

<title>A plea to nvALT users</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16655625/a-plea-to-nvalt-users</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16655625/a-plea-to-nvalt-users</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> nvALT, end of life, modernize, Markdown files, nvUltra
<br />
nvALT已经停止更新，目前几乎无法在现代操作系统上正常运行。建议用户将存储方式转为Markdown文件，以便顺利迁移到新的笔记系统。如果笔记存储为富文本文件(RTF)，则需使用其他应用如nvUltra、The Archive或Obsidian。学习Markdown并不难，只需了解一些简单的语法规则。立即将存储方式改为纯文本文件，以免在nvALT无法运行时无法提取笔记。可能会为nvUltra编写导入器，但目前尚未实现。要获取nvUltra测试版，请通过网站联系链接发送邮件。 <div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I need to keep repeating it based on the number of queries I get. nvALT is at end of life, unless someone picks up the reigns and modernizes the (open source) code base. As it stands now, nvALT <em>barely</em> functions on modern OSs.</p>

<p>Fletcher Penney and I have designed nvALT&rsquo;s successor, <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a>, to work <em>only</em> with a folder full of Markdown files, which is the only way I recommend using nvALT. If your nvALT files are stored as individual Markdown files, switching to nvUltra is no problem, nor is switching to any other Notational-Velocity-like system. It will even work in Obsidian. But if you store your notes as a database only, you&rsquo;re screwed when nvALT stops working for you.</p>

<p>So please, if nvALT is still running for you, go into Preferences-&gt;Notes-&gt;Storage and change &ldquo;Store and read notes on disk as&rdquo; to &ldquo;Plain Text Files.&rdquo; If your previous storage method was database, all of your notes will be immediately written out as plain text files, safe and secure and easy to port to a new (working) notes system. The files will now be in the same folder nvALT shows in the folder selector at the top of the Notes preference pane.</p>

<figure class="alignright">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="nvALT is not even working well enough for me to get a full screenshot. But here is my best attempt." height="521" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/nvalt-prefs.jpg" title="nvALT is not even working well enough for me to get a full screenshot. But here is my best attempt." width="380" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>nvALT is not even working well enough for me to get a full screenshot. But here is my best attempt.</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>If your notes are stored as Rich Text Files (RTF), you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/02/08/convert-nvalt-rtf-files-to-markdown/">convert them to Markdown</a> to make use of other apps like nvUltra, The Archive, or Obsidian. If you don&rsquo;t know Markdown, don&rsquo;t sweat it. It&rsquo;s very easy to learn and it&rsquo;s really just plain text, so as long as you know how to write, you&rsquo;re already kind of writing Markdown. It&rsquo;s only necessary to learn any syntax if you need to do things like create bulleted/numbered lists, add bold or italics, or create links.</p>

<p>So, again, please immediately switch your storage method to plain text files. The nvALT database format has no easy out for people ready to switch. I may try to write an importer for nvUltra (or generally to output Markdown), but I have not done so yet.</p>

<p>If you want on the nvUltra beta, email me through the contact link on <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvultra.com</a>.</p>

<div> blogging, audience building, social media, sponsored posts, search engine traffic
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了在过去10年中博客环境发生的变化。以前博客之间会互相分享，帮助建立观众群体，但现在社交媒体和搜索引擎的影响力增加，导致了独立博客的衰落。赞助文章的回报减少，搜索引擎流量下降，原创内容面临困境。作者认为当前的环境并不利于内容创作者，强调继续支持原创作品的重要性。 <div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging for over 20 years now, making websites for 28 years, and before all of that I was running a BBS that had users from all over the U.S. (but only one phone line/modem, so it was slow communication). And I&rsquo;ve seen an unsettling shift over the last 10 years that I feel like writing about.</p>

<p>It used to be (10, 20 years ago) that birds of a feather in the blogging world would share each other&rsquo;s work and sustainably build audiences together. I was part of an informal &ldquo;network&rdquo; of blogs that frequently shared each other&rsquo;s posts, when they were noteworthy, and getting &ldquo;seen&rdquo; was as easy as making good content. Getting mentioned on a larger site meant measurable traffic and often new subscribers to your work, and it was a meaningful way of building an audience. The audience I currently have is largely a product of those days.</p>

<p>My larger projects brought in new readers. 20 years ago MoodBlast was my starting point, then the Blogsmith Bundle got attention from Merlin Man, Marked got attention from Daring Fireball, and all of that netted new traffic and more followers. These days, it&rsquo;s a lot harder, and the attention of major players has much less impact. Bunch got a fair amount of press. Write-ups in major online media outlets, features from creators like David Sparks, and even some print publications worldwide. And I saw a swell in the number of downloads every time, but none of it filtered back to building my readership. Not the way MoodBlast or Marked did a decade ago.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I&rsquo;m doing better work than ever, and it <em>is</em> getting noticed, it just doesn&rsquo;t tip the needle anymore. I&rsquo;m not suffering for traffic, but &ldquo;new&rdquo; traffic is definitely coming from unusual and unpredictable places that are nearly impossible to capitalize on. Even getting linked on Hacker News doesn&rsquo;t tip the needle the way it used to (or the way getting Dugg used to. IYKYN.). Gone are the days, seemingly, when I could make something new and have &ldquo;major&rdquo; bloggers notice my work, and thus increase readership. I don&rsquo;t even know how to scratch the surface of the largest blogs anymore, and many of the independent blogs that I could count on have gone the way of the Dodo. And I, at the age of 45, do not have the energy and &ldquo;hustle&rdquo; required to make it on new platforms. I will continue doing what I&rsquo;m doing, and will probably eventually follow my peers into digital obscurity. It&rsquo;s not that I steadfastly refuse to adapt to new things, I try new things all the time, it&rsquo;s that these platforms have come to reward behavior I don&rsquo;t think is beneficial to the end user, and I tend to opt out. I&rsquo;m not going to &ldquo;hustle&rdquo; to make more money for someone else, which is the way we&rsquo;ve allowed everything to become structured.</p>

<p>These days, we all share our links into the morass of social media, where even our own followers have a hit-or-miss chance of seeing them, thanks to The Algorithm. We &ldquo;like&rdquo; creators&rsquo; work, but it just becomes a little tick in a metric that&rsquo;s really only useful to advertising companies whose money is primarily going to the platform provider, not the creators that provide its content. Social media sites are invested in keeping you, the viewer, on their platform, and sending you to a third-party site is detrimental to their ad sales and attention metrics. This doesn&rsquo;t, in general, benefit the creators. It benefits the platform. Medium and Substack are truly profitable for a select few, with an intense amount of attention and energy (i.e. hustle) involved in getting there. Creation of original content is not, by and large, rewarded by any of these platforms, and you&rsquo;re ultimately creating content for a corporation to use as they like. Fewer and fewer creators are actually owning the content they create, and it&rsquo;s disheartening.</p>

<p><em>Side note:</em> I&rsquo;ve been reticent to take on new sponsors lately. The returns just aren&rsquo;t there for the sponsor anymore. I don&rsquo;t know why, honestly, but my readership is happy to click on links but hesitant to actually spend money. The economy? I don&rsquo;t know. I just know that I charge a reasonable rate for sponsored posts, but the feedback I&rsquo;ve gotten from sponsors over the last couple of years is that it didn&rsquo;t pay off. Which sucks for all of us. So if you like my work and would like to fund me regardless of sponsors, please <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//support/">become a subscriber</a>!</p>

<p>Search Engine traffic is down for many of us because the major engines&rsquo; output is flooded with ads and content that is, at best, knock-off content designed to spam the results. I think Google and Microsoft have given up on trying to quell the &ldquo;SEO&rdquo; hackers, or even keep up with them. And now they want to spew AI-generated detritus all over the place. Original content is dying, if not dead.</p>

<p>This is all to say that I recognize that things have changed. I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s for the better. Gone are the halcyon days of independent bloggers sharing original work, and the knowledge networks that cropped up between them. Gone are the days of a rising tide that lifts all boats. The tide is just Social Media, and it is, at my most generous, not concerned with the boats. I think, in fact, it&rsquo;s actively hostile toward them.</p>

<p>I will continue to share noteworthy things I find via <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/topic/bookmarks/">Web Excursions</a> and reviews. If you have an article or project you&rsquo;d like to show my audience, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">contact me</a> one of the many ways I&rsquo;m available.

<title>CurlyQ and automated JavaScript execution</title>

<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16641718/curlyq-and-automated-javascript-execution</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> gem install curlyq, JavaScript execution, screenshot command, execute subcommand, web automation tool <br />
<br />
总结: 作者在文章中介绍了对CurlyQ工具的改进，包括添加JavaScript执行功能、改进截图命令、新增执行子命令等。通过对工具的升级，用户可以更方便地进行网页自动化操作，如保存网页截图、执行特定脚本等。这些改进将极大地提高用户的工作效率，特别适用于自动化文档生成等工作。CurlyQ的最新版本已可通过gem install curlyq进行更新或安装。 <div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to add JavaScript execution to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/curlyq/" title="CurlyQ">CurlyQ</a> for a while and finally got around to it.</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;ve missed it, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/curlyq/" title="CurlyQ">CurlyQ</a> is my command-line web automation tool for fetching, parsing, and responding to web page content, designed to be used as part of a *NIX pipeline. It can grab titles, links, metadata, and more from any web page. As part of its functionality, it can also use Firefox or Chrome to save screenshots, and that&rsquo;s part of what I&rsquo;ve improved.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">screenshot</code> command now accepts a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--script</code> parameter. This can be a JavaScript string, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> to read from STDIN, or a path to a file which will be read and executed before taking a screenshot. You can also now define an element ID to wait for before taking the screenshot (or executing the script) using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--id ELEMENT_ID</code>. As long as the ID is a valid element on the page, the screenshot will trigger once that element is loaded (via HTML or dynamically), with a timeout of 10 seconds. You can also define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--wait X</code> flag in the command to wait for a specified number of seconds <em>after</em> executing a script before the screenshot is taken.</p>

<p>Further, I&rsquo;ve added a new subcommand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execute</code>, that has the same parameters as above and simply allows you to load a page in the browser and execute a script on it. I really wanted this because it&rsquo;s the easiest way to automate <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/niftymenu/">NiftyMenu</a>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>curlyq execute -b chrome -s "NiftyAPI.find('file/save').arrow().shoot('file-save')" file:///Users/ttscoff/Desktop/Code/niftymenu/dist/MultiMarkdown-Composer.html</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That command will save a screenshot of the File-&gt;Save menu item for me, allowing me to fully automate menu screenshots for any of my apps. I can have NiftyMenu generate an up-to-date view of the app&rsquo;s menu bar, with styling for the current OS, and output detailed screenshots with callouts automatically. This will be a huge timesaver when it comes to documentation.</p>

<p>You can update/install the latest version of CurlyQ with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install curlyq</code>. The improvements in this post are available as of version 0.0.12. Enjoy!</p>

<title>On using a CDN</title>

<div> CloudFront, CDN, AWS, performance, setup<br />
总结:<br />
文章介绍了如何通过使用CDN（如CloudFront）来提高网站性能，特别推荐使用AWS的CloudFront服务。通过将图片、CSS和JS等资源从CDN而不是服务器（如DreamHost）提供，可以显著提高网站加载速度。作者分享了如何设置CloudFront分发，以及如何进行版本控制和CDN预热。总体而言，使用CDN可以同时提高速度和降低成本。 <div>

                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />

              </noscript>
            

<p>If you run a website and aren&rsquo;t serving your assets from a <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr>, I want to highly recommend that you do so. I&rsquo;ve seen significant performance improvements simply by redirecting my image, CSS, and JS requests to a <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> instead of serving them from a server like DreamHost. I like DreamHost just fine, but the time it takes to serve a file and the download speeds it offers are not&hellip; optimal.</p>

<p>The idea behind a <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> is that your assets are served from a speed-tuned network of servers that can deliver the fastest speeds using servers located as close as possible to the end user. I can serve up a 1MB image file in about 1/2 the time using a <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> versus serving directly from DreamHost.</p>

<h3 id="cloudfront">CloudFront</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/getting-started/">CloudFront</a> (Amazon Web Services) to be the easiest to set up <em>and</em> the most affordable option. There are a few good <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cdn-providers">options to explore</a>, though. I haven&rsquo;t done head-to-head testing of all available options, I just know that CloudFront offers some of the highest speeds and one of the most generous free-tier options.</p>

<p>I can serve <em>all</em> of my sites&rsquo; assets (<a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a>, <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked 2</a>, <a href="https://dimspire.me">Dimspire.me</a>, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com">BrettTerpstra.com</a>, and sundry others), including DMGs, zips, images, CSS/JS files, and more, from AWS for about $2/mo. My total AWS bill is $13/mo, and that includes my Glacier backups and S3 storage. Compared to $20/mo for CloudFlare, it&rsquo;s a pretty easy decision for me. Some of the &ldquo;fancier&rdquo; CDNs can do things like serving different image formats and sizes based on path/query strings, but I haven&rsquo;t been willing to shell out the cash for those.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do a full tutorial on setting up a CloudFront deployment for a website, but the basic steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an AWS account (if needed)</li>
  <li>Navigate to CloudFront</li>
  <li>Create a new distribution</li>
  <li>Set the origin to the url of your website</li>
  <li>Add a CNAME for your distribution</li>
  <li>Generate an SSL certificate (free through Amazon) for the distribution (requires DNS verification of ownership)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the other options can be left to their defaults. <a href="https://medium.com/@AlexanderObregon/creating-a-content-delivery-network-with-amazon-cloudfront-26565c3ceb95">Here&rsquo;s a more in-depth tutorial.</a> Total setup time is about 30 minutes, including waiting for DNS verification and spin-up time. Of course, then you have to modify your site to make use of the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr>. I have solutions for Jekyll and other SSG generators, if you care to ask. There are multiple <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-cdn-services/">WordPress plugins</a> for handling this kind of thing as well.</p>

<h3 id="versioning">Versioning</h3>

<p>Files served from the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> are heavily cached, meaning if you want to serve up a new version of a file, updated CSS for example, you need to &ldquo;bust&rdquo; the cache. This can be done by adding a query string, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?v=123</code> to the file url, but it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/">preferable to use filename versioning</a>. If you&rsquo;re using Apache, you can just include this in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.htaccess</code>:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="gp">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="go">  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
</span><span class="gp">  RewriteRule ^(.+)\.(\d+)\.(js|css|png|jpe?g|gif|rb|json|svg|ico|webp|avif|webm|mp4|zip)$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$1</span>.<span class="nv">$3</span> <span class="o">[</span>L]
<span class="gp">&lt;/IfModule&gt;</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>That will allow you to request <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image.123.jpg</code> and it will serve up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image.jpg</code>, but the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> will see that as a new file request and pull an up-to-date version of the file from the server.</p>

<p>In my Jekyll setup, I have a single version number for the whole site defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> under a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cachebuster</code> key. In my templates I have some logic that determines when the site is rendering in production mode (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JEKYLL_ENV=production</code>), and when it is, it substitutes the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> path and the version number into the URL. For example, if I&rsquo;m in production mode, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://dimspire.me/assets/css/main.css</code> will be written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://cdn.dimspire.me/assets/css/main.123.css</code>. As long as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">123</code> doesn&rsquo;t change, the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> will continue serving the same file, but if I bump it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">124</code>, it will sync the latest version of the file from the server and cache it upon the first request.</p>

<h3 id="priming-the-cdn">Priming the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr></h3>

<p>If you want to avoid anybody having to wait for the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> to ingest a file, cache it, and serve it on the first load, you can make a headers-only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> call to the asset. This is kind of silly, as once any one user in a region has loaded the new asset, it will be served instantly for subsequent loads. But just for fun, I&rsquo;ll share my Rakefile task for syncing the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> after a version bump:</p>

<p>The only important part of that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl -Is [ASSET]</code>, which does a headers-only request for the file, which will cause the <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> to ingest it if it isn&rsquo;t already cached, without actually downloading it. Currently Dimspire.me has about 225 &ldquo;Dimspirations,&rdquo; each with 9 image versions (wallpapers, jpeg, webp and avif versions), and running this after a version bump (meaning <em>none</em> of the assets are cached) takes about five minutes for 2000+ assets. If I&rsquo;m only adding new images and not bumping the version, this task takes under two minutes. Doing the simple curl call above on all of the assets that got &ldquo;revved&rdquo; (bumped) will mean that nobody has to wait for files to be initially cached, but again, this is pretty silly.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3>

<p>If you run a website that serves a lot of images, CSS, or JavaScript, you can see significant performance improvements by using a <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr>. CloudFront is, in my experience, the best combination of fast and affordable. If you want to see more of my Jekyll setup (Rakefile, templates, etc.), just ask. I&rsquo;m always happy to share.</p>

<div> Affinity Photo, Automation, Dimspirations, Hazel, Rake
总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了作者如何利用Affinity Photo和自动化工具来创建Dimspirations图像，并通过Hazel、RetroBatch、Rake等工具自动处理和发布。作者使用Hazel来监控并处理文件，Rake来生成Markdown文件并自动添加元数据，最后通过Howzit来部署网站。整个流程高度自动化，作者只需手动完成图像的创建和简单的编辑，整个发布过程高效顺畅。文章还涉及到了Affinity被Canva收购的猜测和对未来的担忧。整体来说，文章详细解释了作者的工作流程和自动化程序的运作，展示了高效简便的发布流程。 <div>

<p>First, there seems to be a misconception that <a href="https://dimspire.me/">Dimspirations</a> are generated with AI or some other such trickery. I want to assure you that, while the entire process of posting them is automated, each Dimspiration is lovingly crafted by me in Affinity Photo<sup id="fnref:subscription"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:subscription" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I wanted to detail the automation though, partially for my own reference, and partially just because I&rsquo;m pretty proud of the system.</p>

<h3 id="the-template">The Template</h3>

<p>First, I have a template I load up in Affinity Photo. It has guides for all of the various formats that will be produced from the single output file. All I have to do is make sure that the text and necessary parts of background images fit into the smallest guide rectangle, and that the rest of the space is filled with a reasonable amount of background image or matching color. The tallest output is the iPhone version, which on occasion just gets filled with a background color, but I can usually make a background pattern or image fit nicely for iPhone and still look good for all of the other formats.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter zoom">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Affinity Photo template" height="571" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/affinity-template-800.jpg" title="Affinity Photo template" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>Affinity Photo template</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>I have a Dimspirations <a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a> that opens the template in Affinity Photo, loads up the Desktop and Dimspirations folder in Finder tabs (for keeping track of the rest of the process below), and opens up Adobe Stock in my browser for grabbing those sweet, sweet background images. So to get started on a bunch, I just hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hyper-D, Shift-D</code> (my assigned shortcuts in Bunch).</p>

<p>The new Dimspiration gets saved-as with a slugified version of the title I want it to have on the site, e.g. &ldquo;The end of the world&rdquo; gets saved as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-end-of-the-world.afphoto</code>. Then I output a JPEG of the whole image with the same slug (populated by default), tag it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dim</code> in the save panel, and save it to the Desktop.</p>

<h3 id="hazel-and-retrobatch">Hazel and RetroBatch</h3>

<p>Hazel watches the Desktop for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dim</code> JPEGS, removes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dim</code> tag, and automatically opens the image in a <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch 2, from Flying Meat">RetroBatch</a> applet called &ldquo;Dimspiration.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter zoom">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="RetroBatch applet" height="569" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/retrobatch-layout-800.jpg" title="RetroBatch applet" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>RetroBatch applet</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>The RetroBatch applet saves various formats with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-rb</code> suffix (3 desktop wallpapers, 1 iPhone wallpaper, Twitter and Facebook preview images, an Instagram-ready version, and the 1x and 2x versions of the square image for the website). Upon writing the files, they then get sent to  <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac" title="better Save for Web">ImageOptim</a> for optimization. The optimized files get saved to a new &ldquo;Dimspirations&rdquo; folder.</p>

<p>Hazel watches the &ldquo;Dimspirations&rdquo; folder and copies wallpaper formats to an upload folder, where Hazel (again) uploads those images to Flickr as screenshots in a DimPapers album, then deletes the copied files.</p>

<p>Hazel then moves all of the image files to the Dimspire.me website assets folder.</p>

<h3 id="rake-and-howzit">Rake and Howzit</h3>

<p>I then open up iTerm (visor mode because I&rsquo;m not an animal), switch to the dimspire.me directory, and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake</code>. The wallpaper download zips, WEBP and AVIF versions, and Markdown post are created. The Rake task looks for new JPEGs, extracts their base name, and generates Markdown files for any new ones. It automatically adds YAML frontmatter to each post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title extrapolated from the image slug, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end-of-the-world</code> becomes &ldquo;End of the world&rdquo;</li>
  <li>the base image slug, which is used to extrapolate the square and @2x versions for display</li>
  <li>a &ldquo;manifest&rdquo; section with a list of files in the zip download</li>
  <li>An ALT tag auto-generated with <a href="https://github.com/freedmand/textra">textra</a>, which runs Apple&rsquo;s built-in OCR on the image to extract its text</li>
  <li>a short url created with a curl call to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/03/16/build-a-custom-url-shortener/">dim.moi</a></li>
</ul>

<figure class="aligncenter zoom">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="A dimspiration post" height="340" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/dimspirations-post-800.jpg" title="A dimspiration post" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>A dimspiration post</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>The Rake task outputs the Markdown file&rsquo;s filename, which I can just ⌘-Click (iTerm) to open in <a href="https://multimarkdown.com/" title="MultiMarkdown Composer">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>, where I double check the ALT tag and add a snarky caption as the body content.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/howzit/">Howzit</a> <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2022/08/09/getting-started-with-howzit/">buildnotes file</a> I have sections for previewing and deploying, so I can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r deploy</code> to deploy the site, which calls the necessary Rake tasks and uses rsync to copy the entire rendered site to the server. CSS and JS (and all images) are served from a CDN which uses versioning like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filename.1234.css</code>, and if I want to upload changes to any of these files, I need to bump the version number before rendering, so the Howzit task will ask me upon deploy if it should bump the version. If I haven&rsquo;t made any changes and have only added a new Dimspiration, I can just hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and it will avoid clearing the CDN cache.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter zoom">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="buildnotes.md for dimspire.me" height="230" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/04/dimspire-buldnotes-800.jpg" title="buildnotes.md for dimspire.me" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>buildnotes.md for dimspire.me</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>The site runs on Jekyll, so mass updating the posts can be done just by searching and replacing in Markdown files. The Rakefile has tasks for updating all of the zip downloads with any new versions of the images that have been added (and updating the manifest data in every post with any changes), batch adding any missing ALT tags, and creating all missing WEBP and AVIF versions at once. Whenever I just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake</code>, all of these tasks execute in sequence, so every time I publish it&rsquo;s filling in any missing pieces, not just the latest post. It takes about 20 seconds to run all of the tasks on all of the posts at this point, though the zip creation (which rebuilds all zips on every update) will take increasingly longer as the number of posts grows. I&rsquo;ll deal with making it more incremental when that actually becomes a burden.</p>

<p>So my (manual) part of the process is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lovingly craft a Dimspiration in Affinity Photo and save it to the Desktop
    <ul>
      <li>Wait a minute for Hazel/RetroBatch/ImageOption to do their things</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to the Dimspire.me website directory and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake</code></li>
  <li>Open the created post and edit two lines</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howzit -r deploy</code> (which with my aliases and fuzzy completion is just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bld dep</code>, and thanks to Fish&rsquo;s directory-sensitive history, is just a matter of typing <span class="keycombo combined" title="B"><kbd class="key symbol">B</kbd></span><span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-F"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">F</kbd></span>)</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, if you have any questions about <em>any</em> part of this that you&rsquo;d be interested in implementing on your own, please join us <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">in the forum</a> and ask away! And as always, I&rsquo;d love it if you checked out <a href="https://dimspire.me/">Dimspirations</a> and the <a href="https://dimspire.sellfy.store/">Dimspirations Store</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:subscription">
      <p>Affinity was recently acquired by Canva. How much are we betting that it switches from the sweet $50/version pricing to unaffordable subscription pricing within a year? They&rsquo;ve promised to always keep it &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s a very subjective term.&nbsp;<a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:subscription">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Web excursions brought to you in partnership with <a href="https://macpaw.7eer.net/c/228914/82479/1733">CleanMyMac X</a>, all the tools to speed up your Mac, in one app.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://n10.app/">N₁₀ - Attention Management App for Mac</a></dt>
  <dd>A simple, elegant Mac app that allows you to set an intention, define how much time you plan to put into it, and then just sit, quietly reminding you of what you want to be working on with subtle but all-encompassing animations. Perfect for those of us who say &ldquo;OK, now I&rsquo;m really going to work on this&rdquo; and then find ourselves doing something entirely different within five minutes H/T <a href="https://pnw.zone/@jason">Jason Rhemus</a> and props to props to developer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sstephenson">Sam Stephenson</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/12/again-with-man-pages-and-bbedit/">Again with man pages and BBEdit - All this</a></dt>
  <dd>Really nice trick for Terminal junkies who use BBEdit. I have a similar trick for sublime, and one that opens man pages in Preview, but this one provides additional navigation that none of mine have.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://mimestream.com/">Mimestream</a></dt>
  <dd>&ldquo;A native macOS email client for Gmail.&rdquo; This looks so good, especially considering MailPlane is dead. If only I didn&rsquo;t have iCloud and Exchange email accounts I need to deal with, too.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1005243836/interstellar-resin-keycap-interstellar?click_key=15ef6abb904cd0d4cac8e45387bb5a84a185c5f0%3A1005243836&amp;click_sum=61bef45c&amp;pro=1&amp;variation1=2388176515">Interstellar Resin Keycap</a></dt>
  <dd>I ordered this keycap to replace my custom rocket keycap that I use for my hyper key. Available in 2.25u (Enter) size. It should arrive today and I&rsquo;m very excited. I&rsquo;ll post pictures once I&rsquo;ve installed it!</dd>

<title>Revisiting TagFiler and Vitag</title>

<div> TagFiler, Vitag, tagging system, files, Finder

总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了作者使用的两种文件标签系统，分别是TagFiler和Vitag。TagFiler是通过Finder标签进行文件整理的脚本，可以自定义“context”文件夹和相关标签，便于快速定位文件。Vitag则是用于在大量文件中快速添加标签的工具，可以在编辑器中编辑标签后一键保存，省时又方便。作者长期使用这两种工具，提高了文件整理效率，希望读者也能尝试并发现更多创新。 <div>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t mentioned this setup for a while and thought I&rsquo;d remind everyone, especially newer readers, about a rabbit hole they might choose to go down. I haven&rsquo;t updated or changed any of these scripts since posting, and they&rsquo;re all still working well.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-tagfiler">Part 1: TagFiler</h3>

<p>First up, I&rsquo;ll mention <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/7248499">TagFiler</a>. This is a single script that runs via <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/" title="Simply Useful Software">Hazel</a>, sorting files into a shallow filesystem using Finder tags. You set up &ldquo;context&rdquo; folders which are tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=Context</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=Work</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=Personal</code>. Then you create a shallow system of subfolders tagged with relevant keywords, preceded with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@nvultra</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@dimspirations</code>. You can nest those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> folders as deep as you like, but the idea is to make it easy to target them. Then you tag individual files with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#Context :subtopic</code>, and subtopics can be nested like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#Projects :nvultra:marketing:source</code> to file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Projects/nvultra/marketing/source files</code>.</p>

<p>The nice thing about these tags with punctuation is they create something like nested tagging, which Finder lacks. When searching with Spotlight (or <a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/" title="Powerful File Search Tool for Mac">HoudahSpot</a>), you can search any part of a colon-separated tag (this works for any punctuation, TagFiler just uses colons). So with the above example, I can search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag:nvultra tag:source</code> and get the tagged file as a result. Then, when tagging files in Finder (or, again, HoudahSpot as it has great autocompletion for tagging), the tags will autocomplete as if they were nested, and just typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvultra</code> will bring up all of the colon-separated versions of the tag.</p>

<p>This tagging system has been working perfectly for me for years now. I collect all my files throughout the day on my Desktop and in my Downloads folder. Hazel tags new files with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Purple</code>, and then at the end of the day (or the beginning of the next one) I open up a saved search in HoudahSpot that shows me all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Purple</code> files in my main &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; folders. I can then use HoudahSpot&rsquo;s autocompletion to tag the files appropriately, and Hazel just whisks them off to their target folder. This saved search could also just be a Smart Folder in Finder, but Smart Folders can&rsquo;t narrow down to multiple specific directories. In HoudahSpot this can be accomplished using saved searches and filtering.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this system is that I can also find any TagFiler-tagged file using Spotlight without digging through the folders. But if anything ever happened to my tags (a metadata disaster&hellip;), I&rsquo;d still have a reasonable folder structure for finding all of my files. It&rsquo;s also nice when archiving projects to a NAS or other storage system that doesn&rsquo;t have Spotlight searching.</p>

<h4 id="side-note-cdt">Side Note: cdt</h4>

<p>I have a little Bash function called <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2014/06/12/fast-fuzzy-directory-navigation-for-tag-filer/">cdt</a> (with a <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/blob/master/functions/cdt.fish">fish companion function</a>) for navigating TagFiler-tagged directories from Terminal. I don&rsquo;t actually use it much as I have <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2021/12/24/a-fuzzy-cd-command-for-fish/">fuzzy_cd</a> in my Fish setup and it&rsquo;s a bit smarter in general. I can&rsquo;t vouch that it still works as is, but if you wanted to dig in, let me know if you find issues.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-vitag">Part 2: Vitag</h3>

<p>So I do a majority of my tagging in Finder or HoudahSpot. But when I&rsquo;m faced with a large number of files and want to tag them quickly and easily, I use <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/vitag/">vitag</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>By the way, if you do your tagging in Finder, you can <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2015/11/17/smarter-keyboard-shortcuts-for-finder/">add a keyboard shortcut</a> to make popping up the tag dialog keyboard-accessible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vitag loads up a list of files for the current directory (and optionally subdirectories) with bracketed tags after each filename in your editor of choice. I usually use Sublime Text with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-e 'subl -w'</code>, but you can use Vim, NeoVim, BBEdit, VS Code, or any editor that has a CLI tool and the ability to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wait</code> on the command for the window to close  (usually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-w</code>, but see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code> for your tool). You just edit the tags as plain text and when you save and close the file, all of the tags are changed on the files.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Vitag run on my current Desktop files" height="758" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/03/vitagscreenshot-800.jpg" title="Vitag screenshot" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>Vitag screenshot</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>There&rsquo;s no autocomplete by default, although I have written a Sublime package (which I haven&rsquo;t shared because it&rsquo;s <em>very</em> custom) which helps me out with syntax highlighting, snippets, and autocomplete. For the most part, though, I rely on TextExpander snippets for contexts and common sub-tags.</p>

<p>Then I can just copy/paste as needed to fill out the whole batch, along with the search tools in the editor (at the end of a day most of my files in my inboxes will relate to just a couple of projects, so I can copy and paste many of the tags, sometimes modifying just the last element of a colon-separated tag).</p>

<p>For example, the first thing I do on a batch of &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; files is search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Purple</code> and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-G"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">G</kbd></span> through the results to add my tags. You could also remove any line that didn&rsquo;t contain a tag like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Purple</code> &mdash; as long as the filename remains unchanged, deleting a line will have no effect in Vitag. Unlike tools like <a href="https://github.com/trapd00r/vidir" title="trapd00r/vidir:edit">Vidir</a>, Vitag <em>only</em> deals with tags.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>You&rsquo;ll notice a couple of files tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#x#</code>. This is a special tag that I search for with Hazel, which deletes any file containing it. It&rsquo;s my solution for deleting unneeded files when doing my cleanup. It actually moves to Trash rather than outright deleting as you&rsquo;d get in Vidir, which provides the option for undoing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to wrap up, there&rsquo;s nothing new here. I&rsquo;ve been using these tools for years. I just thought I&rsquo;d share them again in case I first talked about them before you started reading. Let me know what innovations you have with your own tagging systems!</p>

<p>Web excursions brought to you in partnership with CleanShot X, the absolute, hands-down best app for Mac screenshots. <a href="https://cleanshot.sjv.io/DKRzyd">Get one of my all-time favorite apps here.</a></p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deckset/id6476942011?ign-itscg=30200&amp;ign-itsct=apps_box_link">Deckset on the App Store</a></dt>
  <dd>Just when I thought Deckset was dead, an iOS version is announced. Create presentations using Markdown, now on your iPhone/iPad.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://ia.net/presenter">iA Presenter</a></dt>
  <dd>A newer option for Markdown-based presentations (from the creators of iA Writer and based on the same engine) that I think this might be even better than Deckset. Going to give it a test run for a while, but off the bat it looks really slick.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/freedmand/textra">freedmand/textra</a></dt>
  <dd>macOS 13+ only, a simple command line interface to the OS&rsquo;s built-in OCR and transcription frameworks. The OCR works really well. Really, really well (I&rsquo;m using it to add automatic ALT tags to <a href="https://dimspire.me/">Dimspirations</a> and it deals with text in crazy fonts on crazy backgrounds). I haven&rsquo;t gone far with testing the audio transcription, but I have high expectations.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://ground.news/">Ground News</a></dt>
  <dd>This is advertised on almost every YouTube channel I subscribe to, so I decided to check it out. It&rsquo;s really good. If you want to break out of your news bubble and understand what the other side is hearing and thinking, Ground News provides all kinds of tools for doing so. Highly recommended. I&rsquo;m trying to get my parents to use it, but even if they don&rsquo;t, it helps me see the headlines that are going to affect them in their bubble so I&rsquo;m not shocked when topics come up that I&rsquo;ve seen no trace of previously.</dd>

<title>Build a custom URL shortener</title>

<div> URL shortener, custom domain, installation, features, inspiration
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了作者如何搭建自己的URL缩短服务，并使用自定义域名。作者选择了现有的工具，进行了修改和定制，最终建立起了一个基本的URL缩短服务。作者详细介绍了安装步骤和新增的功能，以及使用的动机。通过自己的经验，作者希望能鼓舞读者也开展类似的有趣项目，并向大家推荐了一些其他的服务。 <div>

              </noscript>
            

<p>I wanted short urls for <a href="https://dimspire.me">Dimspirations</a>, and I wanted a custom domain name (dim.moi), but didn&rsquo;t want to pay the somewhat exorbitant prices to do so with something like Bit.ly. So I set out to build my own URL shortener.</p>

<p>PHP/mySQL seemed like the path of least resistance on my current server setup, so I went looking for existing tools that met my needs without too much complication. I found <a href="https://github.com/mikecao/shorty">Shorty</a> by <a href="https://github.com/mikecao">Mike Cao</a>, a decade-old project that still worked just fine. I forked it and built a tool called [Shortly] on top of it. It uses all of the base code of Shorty with my own additions, so full credit for this goes to Mike, but it has enough <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/shortly/commit/5c3b64498b8402819ed1ca2c56d3bca8daab3fa7">changes specific to my needs</a> that I&rsquo;m not pushing my fork upstream.</p>

<p>Shortly is a basic URL shortener. You just have to register your short domain, set up basic PHP/mySQL hosting for it, and then install the files. So the total cost is one domain registration, plus whatever hosting you use for it. It requires very few resources, so a simple $5 shared hosting plan will work fine. I have multiple servers where adding new domains doesn&rsquo;t cost me anything, so I went with a Dreamhost server for this and built it for just the cost of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.moi</code> TLD ($30/yr, if I recall correctly).</p>

<p>The install instructions are detailed in the README and on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/shortly">project page</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, just creating a mySQL database and importing an SQL file to set up the simple database. In about 15 minutes you can have a custom URL shortener that outputs urls like <a href="https://dim.moi/eQ">dim.moi/eQ</a> and passes them through to the full url on the target site. All of my Dimspirations now have short urls, and I can generate new ones with a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> call from my build system.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I added to the script:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow limiting shortening to one domain</li>
  <li>Allow forwarding of paths containing hyphens or which are not found in the database to be forwarded to a root url</li>
  <li>Allow appending query strings to urls before shortening or forwarding</li>
  <li>Accept <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">format=qr</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size=XXX</code> to create QR codes for shortened urls</li>
  <li>Add longURL keys to JSON and XML output</li>
  <li>Default to plain text output format, perfect for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> calls</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these settings are detailed in the README and commented in the config file.</p>

<p>For my particular needs, my shortener will only shorten URLs from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dimspire.me</code>, will forward unknown urls like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dim.moi/ether-bunny</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://dimspire.me/dimspiration/ether-bunny/</code>, and will append some UTM parameters to any url it shortens so I can track usage.</p>

<p>Part of the impetus for this was I wanted to include UTM parameters in the links I offered for sharing, but didn&rsquo;t want to make ungainly URLs. With Shortly, I can add any query parameters I like to a url and end up with a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://dim.moi/fR</code> url to share. And I can shorten <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://dimspire.me/dimspiration/optimal-anxiety-level/</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://dim.moi/optimal-anxiety-level/</code> without even using the API (as the unrecognized slug automatically gets forwarded to the base url <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dimspire.me/dimspiration/SLUG</code>).</p>

<p>Hopefully this inspires some fun projects of your own, and revives a great little project that Mike Cao started. It&rsquo;s such a simple concept that I&rsquo;m sure there are dozens, if not hundreds, of permutations of it. This is just the one I found the easiest to hack away at and get running with minimal fuss. Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/shortly">project page</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/shortly">GitHub repo</a> to get started.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside that&rsquo;s not worth it&rsquo;s own post, I also set up a CloudFront instance that forwards <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from.ttscoff.me/(filename)</code> from an S3 bucket, and added a Dropzone destination so I can just drag any file to Dropzone and get back a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from.ttscoff.me</code> URL with which I can share any file. It lacks all of the niceties of other file-sharing tools, but I&rsquo;m running it for less than a dollar a month. Subdomain was free, and it doesn&rsquo;t use enough bandwidth to really register as an expense in my Amazon plan. If you want any details on how to do this, just let me know.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created the initial round of merchandise for the <a href="https://dimspire.me/store/">Dimspirations Store</a>. I know my sense of humor isn&rsquo;t for everyone, which is why this whole project is on a different site.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started with some of my personal favorites as tees, mugs, and a 2024 calendar. The collection will grow over time (it&rsquo;s print-on-demand, no cost to me to expand the selection). I&rsquo;ll also adjust pricing based on feedback. I think the prices are pretty competitive based on what I&rsquo;ve spent on merch myself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://sellfy.com/" title="Sellfy-Sell Your Products Online Hassle-free">Sellfy</a> for the printing and delivery. I&rsquo;ve used Spring in the past and checked out Printful and Cotton Bureau, but Sellfy seemed like the best solution with the most competitive pricing. I already paid for a 1-year package, so let&rsquo;s hope it works out. If it does, I&rsquo;ll probably relaunch the BrettTerpstra.com (Lab) merchandise there as well.</p>

<p>Please do <a href="https://dimspire.me/store/">check out the store</a>, and if you like what you see, toss a couple bucks my way. And if you don&rsquo;t see what you want, be sure to upvote your favorites <a href="https://dimspire.me/">Dimspirations</a> by clicking the devil below each one. If you have special requests, <em>of course</em> <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, this one is my favorite:</p>

Alfred的workflow Cluster与Bunch紧密集成，使生活变得更加轻松。还有色彩缤纷的虚无主义迷因来提高心情。此外，还有macOS上简单而强大的键盘增强工具，Backblaze可安全可靠地将整个计算机数据备份到云端。 Matt Webb的帖子谈论了科技走入了一个令人不安的境地，但或许这并不是件坏事。 <div>

<p>Effective communication is key in the workplace. With it, we can complete tasks on time and meet sales goals. Yet, essential messages can sometimes get lost in our busy inboxes.</p>

<p>This is where reminder emails come into play&mdash;they serve as gentle nudges to keep tasks on track without being overly intrusive. Crafting a reminder email that is polite, clear, and actionable requires finesse. Luckily, these best practices and examples can help you write an effective reminder email that helps you achieve your goals without sounding rude.</p>

<h3 id="1-begin-with-a-polite-greeting">1. Begin with a Polite Greeting</h3>

<p>Start your reminder email with a courteous greeting to set a positive tone. Whether you&rsquo;re addressing a colleague, client, or team member, a friendly salutation can go a long way in fostering goodwill.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subject: Friendly Reminder: Upcoming Team Meeting<br />
Dear [Recipient&rsquo;s Name],</p>

  <p>I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to gently remind you about our upcoming team meeting scheduled for [date and time]. Your presence and input are highly valued, so we look forward to you joining us.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-provide-context">2. Provide Context</h3>

<p>Clearly state the purpose of your email and provide relevant context to jog the recipient&rsquo;s memory. Be concise yet comprehensive, ensuring that the recipient understands why the reminder is necessary and what action is expected from them.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As our project deadline is approaching, it&rsquo;s crucial that we finalize the presentation slides by [deadline date]. Your expertise in [specific area] will be invaluable in ensuring the success of this project. Please review the attached draft and provide your feedback at your earliest convenience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="3-be-specific">3. Be Specific</h3>

<p>Specify the task or event that requires attention, including any pertinent details such as deadlines, locations, or action items. Avoid vague language that could lead to confusion or misunderstanding.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please submit the quarterly sales report by [deadline date]. This report is essential for our planning and decision-making processes. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you require any assistance or additional information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="4-include-a-call-to-action">4. Include a Call to Action</h3>

<p>Clearly outline the steps the recipient needs to take and any deadlines associated with those actions. A call to action provides clarity and encourages prompt response or action.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To confirm your attendance, please RSVP by clicking on the following link: [RSVP link]. If you cannot attend, kindly let us know so we can make the necessary arrangements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are concerned your call to action may not be strong enough or elicit a timely response, you can always use the <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/139-reminders-overview-what-are-sanereminders-and-how-do-they-work">SaneReminders</a> feature from SaneBox to help you follow up later on. Think of it like a timer: you specify the information with an @sanebox.com email in the To or CC line, and SaneBox takes care of the rest.</p>

<h3 id="5-express-appreciation">5. Express Appreciation</h3>

<p>Express gratitude for the recipient&rsquo;s cooperation and assistance. Acknowledging their efforts reinforces positive behavior and encourages continued collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your continued dedication to our team&rsquo;s success. Your contributions are truly valued and appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="6-use-a-polite-closing">6. Use a Polite Closing</h3>

<p>End your email with a polite closing that leaves a positive impression. A courteous farewell demonstrates professionalism and respect for the recipient&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once again, thank you for your cooperation. We look forward to your prompt response. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="avoid-email-reminders-altogether-with-sanebox">Avoid Email Reminders Altogether With SaneBox</h3>

<p>Writing an effective reminder email requires a balance of politeness, clarity, and specificity. However, your workplace can avoid lost messages and overloaded inboxes altogether by utilizing a mailbox management app like SaneBox.</p>

<div> site, collection, review, support, materials
总结:<br /><br />文章提到了新网站的推出，作者对网站的付出和希望得到评论的愿望，以及对读者的支持。网站包含了虚无主义的灵感和壁纸。作者期待读者的支持和评论。 <div>

<p>On a whim I&rsquo;ve put the new <a href="https://dimspire.me">Dimspire.me</a> site <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dimspire-me">up on Product Hunt</a>. I&rsquo;ve been putting a lot of love into it and even if I were to stop now, I think it&rsquo;s a great collection of nihilist inspirations (and wallpapers), enough to last quite a while. I&rsquo;d love it if you&rsquo;d take a second and leave a review.</p>

<div> RSS feed, subscription, email, monetize, political

这是一篇关于Dimspire Me网站的文章，介绍了他们新增了RSS feed订阅和通过邮件订阅的功能。同时作者表示如果网站有商业化可能的话，将通过出售商品来实现，而不是收费订阅。作者还表示会尽量减少涉及政治的内容，因为有些读者对此表示反感。最后作者呼吁读者点赞和分享这篇文章以及支持他们的项目。总结：文章介绍了Dimspire Me网站新增的订阅功能以及未来可能进行商业化运营的打算，同时表示会尽量减少政治相关内容。 <div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added (well, fixed) the RSS feed for <a href="https://dimspire.me/">Dimspire.me</a>. You can now subscribe via your favorite feed reader at <a href="https://feedpress.me/dimspire.html">Dimspirations RSS</a> (or just enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://dimspire.me</code> in your subscribe field, the feeds are discoverable). The feed is available in XML and JSON flavors, and each entry just contains a pithy description and one image.</p>

<p>You can also sign up to receive Dimspirations in your email, max one email per day, and only when there&rsquo;s new stuff:</p>

<form action="https://app.feedpress.com/e/mailverify" class="form" method="post" target="popupwindow">
<div>
<label>Enter your e-mail address:</label>
<input id="email" name="email" style="margin: 1em 0;" type="text" />
</div>
<div>
<input name="feed_id" type="hidden" value="dimspire" />
<button class="button round" id="submit" name="submit" style="width: 400px;" type="submit">Dimspire Me</button>
</div>
</form>

<p>Thanks for supporting this little project. I&rsquo;ve decided if I ever monetize it, it will be through merch (posters, calendars, coffee mugs, etc.). So the wallpapers and dismal inspirations will continue to be free online.</p>

<p>P.S. I&rsquo;ve received some flack for occasionally going &ldquo;political&rdquo; with the Dimspirations. I don&rsquo;t think things like being disgusted by a lack of gun control, being anti-genocide, or laughing at manufactured outrage are extreme political views, but I promise to keep those to a minimum. Sometimes I get a little fired up &mdash; don&rsquo;t let it scare you away.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep last night. I&rsquo;m not manic, I&rsquo;m just going through this months-long bout of insomnia. At least I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m manic. It doesn&rsquo;t have any of the characteristics of my usual mania. And up until last night I wasn&rsquo;t even getting out of bed when I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. But last night I did, and I made you a website.</p>

<p>Introducing <a href="https://dimspire.me">Dimspire.me</a>. It&rsquo;s built on Jekyll and has a bunch of automations. I can essentially create a &ldquo;dimspiration&rdquo; using an <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/" title="award-winning photo editing software">Affinity Photo</a> template, and then <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch 2, from Flying Meat">RetroBatch</a> will output wallpaper sizes (including iPhone) and square versions for posting and populating the gallery. Just running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake</code> will find new photos added to the assets folder and generate posts for them, which will then populate the index pages. It should be pretty simple to maintain. All documented in a <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/howzit/">Howzit</a> notes file, of course.</p>

<p>The site is pretty simple: a homepage with description and the latest few posts, a &ldquo;Dimspirations&rdquo; page that&rsquo;s essentially a blog post index but done in gallery fashion, and a <a href="https://dimspire.me/random.html">random dimspiration</a> page that will just throw single random dimspirations at you. Fun stuff.</p>

<p>When viewing a single Dimspiration (by clicking on any thumbnail), you get some cool UI showing edges of the previous and next Dimspiration. I like it, anyway. There&rsquo;s still some work to do on certain breakpoints, but overall the styling should work on any device. And every Dimspiration page has a download button, where you can download all available versions of the current Dimspiration. This is accomplished by a Rake task that parses every post, extracts the YAML key that defines the image for the page, then zips up every file in the assets directory that matches it. It creates a manifest table that shows what&rsquo;s in the zip file, with each individual file linked. So when there are wallpaper versions of a Dimspiration, you can download the set or follow a link to a specific version. Took a little thinking and tweaking, but I think it&rsquo;s a good solution.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it. It&rsquo;s cathartic for me to create these, and they&rsquo;re getting better with time. I&rsquo;m not going to try to monetize any of this at this point, but I&rsquo;ve watermarked all the images so if you share them, they should trace back to me. Speaking of, I do still need to consider adding share buttons to these&hellip; but it always freaks me out how much data social sites collect when you include their button, so I&rsquo;ll need to figure out ways around that. We&rsquo;ll call that &ldquo;next step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Love always,<br />
Brett</p>

<title>A Cerakey ceramic keycap review</title>

<div> ceramic keycaps, backlit, sound, pros and cons, personal experience <br />
<br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了作者购买陶瓷键帽的经验。键帽在背光下呈现出独特的外观，但字体在背光下比较难辨认。此外，键帽的声音也有所改变，失去了原本机械键盘的特有“咔嗒”声。作者个人认为这是个人取向的问题。总之，作者对陶瓷键帽的使用体验较为满意，但也提到了一些改进的空间。 <div>
<p>I recently purchased some <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/">Cerakey</a> ceramic keycaps for my <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a>. When I mentioned the purchase on Mastodon, I got a few replies asking for a review, as multiple people had been considering the purchase. So here it is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I have 3 cats. I tried to clean the keyboard up as much as possible before I took photos, but if you have cats, you know how that can go. I did my best.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-look">The Look</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the keys look sans backlighting:</p>

              <figcaption>Keyboard split, unlit</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>I originally ordered the <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/products/full-set-v2?variant=41532871508107">&ldquo;Crazed&rdquo; keycaps</a> (pictured below), but after paying for them I was notified that there was an error between actual stock and what Shopify listed, so instead they sent me <em>two</em> sets, in Canal Blue and Water Blue. So I combined them, as seen above. The Q&ndash;R keys of the left half are Canal Blue, the right half is Water Blue.</p>

<p>I really like the crackled look of the Crazed keys, so I might order those in the future when they&rsquo;re back in stock:</p>

              <figcaption>Crazed Cerakeys</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>One nice thing about ceramic keycaps is the way they glow when backlit. If you don&rsquo;t have a backlit keyboard, you&rsquo;ll only be concerned with the sound and weight, which I&rsquo;ll detail below. But if you have backlighting:</p>

                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Comparison of shine-through PBTs and Cerakey legends" height="132" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/backlitlegends.jpg" title="Comparison of shine-through PBTs and Cerakey legends" width="400" />

              <figcaption>Comparison of shine-through PBTs and Cerakey legends</figcaption>
            </figure>
<p>Unlike shine-through keycaps, the legends are actually harder to read when backlit. I&rsquo;m a touch typist and never look at my keys, so it&rsquo;s kind of a moot point for me. The only time I need to look at the keyboard is when I&rsquo;m typing a number without my fingers on the home row (e.g. 2FA auth code when I&rsquo;m also holding my phone). If you hunt and peck <em>and</em> have a backlit keyboard, you might want to think twice.</p>

<p>Seriously, the overall aesthetic of backlit ceramics is (to me) the coolest I&rsquo;ve seen. This will depend on personal preference, and there are plenty of backlighting setups I&rsquo;ve never tried, but:</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
              
                <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                  <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                  <source type="image/webp" />
                  <source />
                  <img alt="Keyboard split, backlit" height="449" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/split-top-lit.jpg" title="Keyboard split, backlit" width="800" />
                </noscript>
              
              <figcaption>Keyboard split, backlit</figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>The keys have a shine to them. They look like a polished plastic. I guess they look like what you&rsquo;d expect a laquered ceramic surface to look like. I find it pleasing, but again, it&rsquo;s going to depend on personal preference.</p>

<p>If you like multi-colored keyboards, you&rsquo;re going to drop some cash as Cerakey only sells full sets in one color. I would love it if you could combine colors to create a custom layout. I would also appreciate being able to get single custom keys, as the UHK has a very <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/layout-and-keycaps">unique layout</a> that no standard keycap set will cover. While I was customizing, I went ahead and ordered the 1.75U space bars that the UHK uses <a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-artisan">from Asymplex</a> (h/t <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BrokenFlows">@BrokenFlows</a>).</p>

<h3 id="the-sound">The Sound</h3>

<p>My box white switches with ceramic keys have less click, which at first blush is a con to me. I picked the box white switches for my UHK because they had what I found to be the perfect amount of clickiness with PBT keycaps. The ceramic keys remove most of the click, and replace it with a pretty bassy thock. I&rsquo;m currently deciding whether that&rsquo;s a compromise I&rsquo;m willing to make, or whether I&rsquo;m going to swap them out for blue switches (or go back to PBT keycaps).</p>

<p>To be fair, hit softly and one-at-a-time, they still click just fine. It&rsquo;s just the thunder of rapid-fire typing that lacks the click I find so satisfying on my mechanical keyboards.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the ceramic keycaps sound on my UHK with Box White switches:</p>

<figure class="audio"><audio controls="true"><source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/cerakey-on-box-white.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /><source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/cerakey-on-box-white.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />HTML5 audio not supported </audio><figcaption>"Cerakey on Box White" </figcaption></figure>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the original PBT keycaps sound:</p>

<figure class="audio"><audio controls="true"><source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/pbt-on-box-white.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /><source src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2024/02/pbt-on-box-white.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />HTML5 audio not supported </audio><figcaption>"PBT on Box White" </figcaption></figure>

<p>Next to each other for comparison:</p>

<p>And just for reference, here&rsquo;s the Cerakey on a Cherry Blue switch:</p>

<p>And for comparison, PBT on Cherry Blue:</p>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

<p>I would consider the loss of click a con, but that&rsquo;s an entirely personal opinion. As described above, Cherry Blue switches actually sound pretty good. Basically like Box White switches with PBT keycaps.</p>

<p>The one thing that does bug me is there&rsquo;s no discernible bump on the F and J keys, so I do have to look down to find the home row. I&rsquo;m going to fix this with a home brew solution, eventually. Maybe a little epoxy and some <a href="https://amzn.to/3SLSGs6">Sugru</a>. Most glues and resins won&rsquo;t stick to the ceramic surface, so this is going to take a little work. I don&rsquo;t have feeling in the tips of my fingers on my right hand (I don&rsquo;t know why, this only happened in the last 10 years), so I need a big bump to be able to feel it. This is probably less of a problem for others, but in recent years it&rsquo;s taken a little customization for me, even when there <em>are</em> ridges on the F and J.</p>

<p>The harder-to-read legends on backlit ceramic keys is a little bit of a bummer. As I said above, it doesn&rsquo;t really affect me, but it might be something to note.</p>

<h3 id="neither-pro-nor-con">Neither Pro Nor Con</h3>

<p>The keys are slippery. This is kind of a non-issue, it turns out. I thought the slick surface of the keys would affect my typing speed and error rate, but it really doesn&rsquo;t. If anything I actually type a little faster on these, but it&rsquo;s a negligible difference.</p>

<h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use these for a couple months and see if I miss the PBT keys at all. So far I don&rsquo;t, and I love the look. I <em>would</em> like to get the <a href="https://www.cerakey.com/products/full-set-v2?variant=41532871508107">Crazed</a> version eventually, but I&rsquo;ve spent enough money on keycaps for a while. I&rsquo;ll eventually want to replace the modifier keys, but will have to find a custom solution for those.</p>

<p>I have to decide how important the click I was used to is. I&rsquo;m finding the overall sound of these pretty pleasing after a few days with them. But my modifier keys and space bars are still PBT, so I hear the click after every word. This makes the difference obvious, but also gives me a certain amount of satisfaction that might tide me over.</p>

<p>I hope this helps answer some questions. I take no responsibility for your purchase, but now you have the benefit of my experience.</p>

<div> #dimspirations, automation, wallpaper, gallery, feedback
总结:<br /><br />作者创建了一个名为#dimspirations的系列“inspirational”海报，并自动化了壁纸格式的创建。作者考虑建立一个易于维护的网站来展示这些作品，并考虑通过Patreon等方式获取支持。读者被邀请分享反馈和建议。 <div>

              </noscript>
            

<p>I&rsquo;ve started creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/dimspirations/">Dimspirations</a> again, my depressing-but-actually-realistic collection of &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; posters. You can follow the hashtag #dimspirations on Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon, or Instagram for new posts. I&rsquo;ve also automated the process of creating wallpaper-formatted version of them which get <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/circlesixdesign/albums/72157697001065435">uploaded to Flickr</a> and are also <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/otherstuff/wallpaper/">available as a zip</a> (containing 5120x3200 and 2048x1366 versions). I should probably add an iPhone ratio to the automation, but they get harder to resize vertically from one image. Anyway, if you&rsquo;re in the mood to be &ldquo;dimspired,&rdquo; check them out.</p>

<p>By the way, if you&rsquo;ve never checked it out, the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/otherstuff/">&ldquo;Other Stuff&rdquo;</a> section (where my wallpapers are located) has some fun projects in it. Fun for me, anyway.</p>

<p>Side tangent: I own the domain dimspire.me, and have always meant to find a way to make an easy-to-maintain gallery out of these. Probably a blog-style thing with daily or weekly dimspirations, with basic comments functionality and links to download the square or wallpaper versions. The index page would just be a thumbnail gallery with the main image from each post. It might actually be nice to do a paywall and have the wallpaper versions supported by Patreon or something. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone would actually pay for these. I&rsquo;ve seen similar projects sold as books, and I feel like the designs are actually pretty good for print, so maybe someday. Anyway, my inclination is to do this site in Jekyll (which I&rsquo;m very adept at), but would be open to any suggestions as to what the best way to accomplish this would be. I&rsquo;m not even opposed to WordPress with some custom plugins (which I&rsquo;m also surprisingly adept at), which would be pretty easy to automate and then I could use MarsEdit to maintain it. Still pondering.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please share your feedback (and any suggestions, should the dimspiration strike)!</p>

  <dd>I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/">HoudahSpot</a> plenty of times, but there&rsquo;s an app that&rsquo;s been around since about 2005 that has been continually updated and only costs $6-10 that&rsquo;s worth checking out if you constantly run into hard-to-find files. One major benefit of Find Any File is that it can search your NAS and doesn&rsquo;t rely on Spotlight for indexing. Searches can be a little slow but they are VERY accurate. Allows saving searches and search templates, and can export found files as a list for use in scripting app&hellip; uses a pay-what-you-can shareware model (oh, the old days!). Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2023/12/find-any-file/">great review from Allison Sheridan</a> with much more detail.</dd>

  <dd>If you&rsquo;ve followed me for the last few years, you know I swear by iThoughts for my mind mapping needs (of which I have a lot). I&rsquo;m pretty devastated to see that the developer has moved on and there will be no future releases of the app on any platform. I checked in with him, he says he&rsquo;s fine, he just moved on. Fair enough. Now I have to pick a new favorite mind mapping tool. Open to your thoughts!</dd>

<div> nvALT, RTF, Markdown, Shortcut, Conversion<br />
这篇文章介绍了一个将RTF文件转换为Markdown的快捷方式，帮助那些想从nvALT转移到其他应用的用户。作者提到了从nvALT转移到nvUltra或Obsidian等Markdown应用的情况，并分享了一个使用Shortcuts的解决方案。他还提到了对Shortcuts的使用方法和可能的问题，并鼓励读者提出改进建议或疑问。总的来说，这篇文章是一个为nvALT用户提供帮助的实用指南。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了如何使用Shortcuts将RTF文件转换为Markdown，以帮助nvALT用户迁移到其他应用。提供了详细的使用方法和可能的问题，并鼓励读者参与讨论。 <div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with a former nvALT user who stored all of their files in RTF format. Ideally, people switching from nvALT to another app &mdash; be it nvUltra, Obsidian, or anything Markdown-based &mdash; would already be storing their notes as individual text files. If nvALT is still working for you, make that change now and give it a chance to write all the new files to disk. However, if the conversion isn&rsquo;t what you hoped for, or nvALT is no longer working on your machine and you&rsquo;re stuck with a bunch of RTF files, I&rsquo;ve pulled together a solution.</p>

<h3 id="thanks-for-the-assist">Thanks for the assist</h3>

<p>A big thanks to those on <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">the forum</a> and some help from Mastodon, especially @atnbueno and @jackwellborn, for helping me get a grasp on some more advanced Shortcuts implementations. The following solution should work with zero extra dependencies, i.e. you don&rsquo;t have to install Pandoc or anything like that.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>To use the Shortcut, just <a href="https://brettterpstra.com#dl">download below</a>, double click to unzip, and then double click the resulting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.shortcut</code> file to add it to the Shortcuts app. Then just run it from the main screen (click the Play icon). It will first ask you for a source folder, at which point you&rsquo;ll select the folder containing all of the RTF files. You may be presented with some permissions dialogs as it parses and converts the files, mostly around allowing access to web domains. Don&rsquo;t worry, the Shortcut isn&rsquo;t actually accessing those domains or sending any information to them. Once the conversion has run, you&rsquo;ll get another file dialog at which point you&rsquo;ll create or select an output folder for the Markdown files.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tested this on a collection of about 500 notes and it works pretty well. There are some things that don&rsquo;t convert quite right, especially when lists are created in RTF using individual bullet markers. Those aren&rsquo;t recognized as lists and will not be converted to Markdown lists. They still look correct in the output, though.</p>

<h3 id="dl">Download</h3>

<div class="download" id="dlbox"><h4>nvALT RTF to Markdown Shortcut v1.0.0</h4><p class="dl-icon"><a href="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/downloads/nvalt2markdown1.0.0.zip" title="Download nvALT RTF to Markdown Shortcut v1.0.0"><img height="100" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/images/shortcutsicon.png" width="100" /></a></p><div class="dl-body"><p class="dl-link"><a href="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/downloads/nvalt2markdown1.0.0.zip" title="Download nvALT RTF to Markdown Shortcut v1.0.0">Download nvALT RTF to Markdown Shortcut v1.0.0</a></p><p class="dl-description">A Shortcut to convert a folder of RTF files into Markdown for use in apps like Obsidian or nvUltra.</p><p class="dl-published">Published 02/08/24.</p><p class="dl-updated">Updated 02/08/24. <a class="changelog" href="https://brettterpstra.com">Changelog</a></p><p class="dl-info"><a href="https://brettterpstra.com//donate/">Donate</a> &bull; <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//2024/02/08/convert-nvalt-rtf-files-to-markdown" title="More information on nvALT RTF to Markdown Shortcut">More info&hellip;</a></p></div></div>

<title>Checking for a VPN connection part 2</title>

<div> scutil, VPN连接, 脚本, grep, 网络接口

VPN连接状态检测的脚本可以通过使用scutil命令和grep来进行。通过检查返回值来确定VPN连接的状态，这个脚本可以让你更清晰地监控VPN的连接情况。总结: scutil命令和grep在脚本中被用来检测VPN连接状态，让你能够更有效地管理网络接口变化。 <div>
<p>Ok, so I wrote <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//2024/01/29/checking-for-a-vpn-connection-from-the-command-line/">yesterday</a> about a solution for checking your VPN connection via a network interface change, but it turns out there&rsquo;s a better way to do it. I discovered it shortly after posting (StackExchange thread), and received a few comments mentioning it. So here&rsquo;s part two.</p>

<p>The command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scutil</code>, used for managing (s)ystem (c)onfiguration parameters. The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scutil --nc list</code> will show your available VPN devices and their state, either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connected</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disconnected</code>. By doing a case-sensitive grep for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connected</code> we can determine if one or more is connected.</p>

<p>So now the script just look like:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do
  </span><span class="nv">RES</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>scutil <span class="nt">--nc</span> list | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> Connected<span class="sb">`</span>
  <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$RES</span> <span class="o">==</span> 0 <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">break
  sleep </span>1
<span class="k">done

</span>say <span class="s2">"VPN disconnected"</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scutil --nc list | grep -c Connected</code> should return 0 if no VPN is connected, which you can then use to light up a button, integrate into launch/quit scripts, etc. Just a cleaner way to do what I showed yesterday.</p>

<p>Trevor Manternach has an interesting post using <a href="https://trevormanternach.com/2024/01/12/using-bartender-to-only-display-wireguard-icon-if-connected-to-vpn/">this trick with Wirecast and Bartender</a>.</p>

<div> ifconfig，VPN连接，shell脚本，Mac，自动化<br />
总结：<br />
本文介绍了如何使用ifconfig和shell脚本来检测VPN连接是否处于活动状态，并在连接断开时终止应用程序。通过查找特定的网络接口来确定VPN连接状态，并使用grep命令来测试连接是否处于活动状态。作者提出了使用循环的Bash脚本来监测VPN连接状态，并在连接断开时执行特定命令。同时，还提到了可以将这些方法应用于自动化工具，如BetterTouchTool。 <div>
<p>I got a question from a reader about how to test if a VPN connection is active and terminate an app if it isn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s probably a way to do this with Keyboard Maestro or BetterTouchTool or something, but to keep things interesting, I wanted to find a way to do it with just shell scripts.</p>

<h3 id="vpn-connection-indicators">VPN connection indicators</h3>

<p>I think the easiest, most universal way to determine if a VPN is connected is by searching for a specific interface that changes when connected. When I connect Nord, for example, I get a new network interface called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utun4</code>. I don&rsquo;t know how universal this is, but you can figure out what changes happen in interfaces by comparing the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> when the VPN is connected vs. disconnected.</p>

<p>The following instructions are Mac-specific, using the tools <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pbcopy</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pbpaste</code> to access the system clipboard rather than creating multiple files. In fact, I&rsquo;m not even positive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> is available on all systems, so if anyone wants to contribute instructions for other platforms, please do.</p>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>Caveat: I do not understand the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> command at all and have never used it for anything but listing network interfaces. There may be a far more succinct way to do the following.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To determine the interface changes on a Mac:</p>

<p>In Bash:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c"># Disconnect VPN</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>ifconfig <span class="nt">-a</span> | pbcopy
<span class="c"># Connect VPN</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>diff &lt;<span class="o">(</span>ifconfig <span class="nt">-a</span><span class="o">)</span> &lt;<span class="o">(</span>pbpaste<span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Zsh:</p>

<div class="language-zsh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c"># Disconnect VPN</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>ifconfig <span class="nt">-a</span> | pbcopy
<span class="c"># Connect VPN</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>diff <span class="o">=(</span>ifconfig <span class="nt">-a</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=(</span>pbpaste<span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Fish:</p>

<pre><code class="language-fish"># Disconnect VPN
$ ifconfig -a | pbcopy
# Connect VPN
$ diff (ifconfig -a|psub) (pbpaste|psub)
</code></pre>

<p>The result should look something like:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="go">142a143,146
</span><span class="gp">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>utun4: <span class="nv">flags</span><span class="o">=</span>8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1420
<span class="gp">&gt;</span><span class="w">       </span><span class="nv">options</span><span class="o">=</span>6460&lt;TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO,PARTIAL_CSUM,ZEROINVERT_CSUM&gt;
<span class="gp">&gt;</span><span class="w">       </span>inet 10.5.0.2 <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> 10.5.0.2 netmask 0xffff0000
<span class="gp">&gt;</span><span class="w">       </span>nd6 <span class="nv">options</span><span class="o">=</span>201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt;</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="testing-for-connection">Testing for connection</h3>

<p>Now you have an interface name (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utun4</code> above) that you can grep for to test whether the VPN is active. A simple loop in a Bash script will allow you to take action when the connection is disconnected. This little script assumes the VPN is connected when it starts, loops until the network interface we&rsquo;re looking for disappears (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep --count</code> returns 0), then executes the command after the loop.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do
  </span><span class="nv">RES</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>ifconfig <span class="nt">-a</span> | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> utun4<span class="sb">`</span>
  <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$RES</span> <span class="o">==</span> 0 <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">break
  sleep </span>1
<span class="k">done

</span>say <span class="s2">"VPN disconnected"</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect if you wanted to, say, stop a torrent client if the VPN wasn&rsquo;t active. You could embelish it into a launch script that checked for the VPN first, launching an app when the VPN is connected, then polled for the VPN to be disconnected, terminating the app if it is.</p>

<p>Of course, the simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig -a | grep -c utun4</code> line could be used as part of a BetterTouchTool widget to display an alert on your Stream Deck when the VPN was connected, or to run any kind of automations on a polling basis. If I had more complex applications for this, I&rsquo;d switch over to using <a href="https://folivora.ai/" title="BetterTouchTool">BetterTouchTool</a>.</p>

<p>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Matthias, I&rsquo;m the developer of Yoink, Transloader, and Tameno, among others.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce another one of my apps to you: ScreenFloat. Over eleven years after its initial v1 release, and after more than a year and a half of development, ScreenFloat 2 is finally here &mdash; rebuilt from the ground up, based on the core functionality that made it so beloved, but improving it in numerous, incredibly useful ways.</p>

<p>Capture screenshots, record your screen, or take timed screenshots. Re-capture shots without painstakingly reframing them. Import from your clipboard, other apps, your Desktop, or your iOS devices.</p>

<p>Float screenshots and recordings above all your other windows, apps and spaces, so information or reference material is always visible, no matter what you do. It&rsquo;s like picture-in-picture, but for your captures.</p>

<p>Texts, faces and barcodes are detected in every shot you take and can effortlessly be extracted/copied and non-destructively redacted with a simple right-click.</p>

<p>Mark up and annotate your screenshots with lines, arrows, checkmarks, highlights, smart bullet points, redactions and more. All non-destructively, so you can always go back and make changes or restore the original capture.</p>

<p>Pick colors from any floating shot. Crop, &ldquo;fold&rdquo;, resize, rotate, &ldquo;de-retinize&rdquo;, trim, and mute your shots.</p>

<p>Sharing floating shots is just a file drag away, with on-the-fly changing of file format and sizing options, whether or not annotations should be included, and more.</p>

<p>Set up double-click workflows for repetitive tasks, like de-retinize the shot, resize it to 75% and then attach it to an email.</p>

<p>Your captures are stored in ScreenFloat&rsquo;s Shots Browser, where you can name, tag, favorite and rate them, and organize them with folders and smart folders. They can also (optionally) be synchronized across your Macs over iCloud.</p>

<p>Find all your shots system-wide or in the Shots Browser by their metadata &mdash; including detected text and barcode content.</p>

<p>And more!</p>

<p>A screenshot is just a screenshot. Until you use ScreenFloat. <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/ScreenFloat" rel="nofollow">Check it out today.</a></p>

  <dd>Matthias Gansrigler has released v2 of ScreenFloat, one of my favorite apps from years ago. A lot of its functionality was replaced by CleanShot X for me in recent years, but the shots browser, tagging, and smart folders set it apart. The basic idea is you can float a screenshot above all other windows and it follows you between spaces, but v2 goes a lot further. Check it out.</dd>

  <dd>Back in 2020 I published a tip to make the now-hidden proxy icons in macOS show up instantly on rollover, but it turns out that since then Apple has added a preference to just show them all the time. Thanks to Pim for pointing this out.</dd>

<div> 截图功能, 动态网页, Selenium, CurlyQ, 改进
总结:
本文介绍了CurlyQ工具的新功能和改进。首先是返回结果的格式统一为数组，即使只有一个结果。其次是添加了--query功能，可以使用jq-like语法查询多个项目，进行属性比较等。最后介绍了CurlyQ的截图功能，通过Selenium可以对动态网页进行截图，并提供了详细的命令行参数说明。文章强调了CurlyQ仍在持续改进，并欢迎读者的反馈和建议。 <div>

              </noscript>
            

<p>I&rsquo;ve been putting a little more time into <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/curlyq/" title="CurlyQ">CurlyQ</a> this week, as I&rsquo;m able.</p>

<p>First thing to note is a breaking change: it will always return an array now, even if there&rsquo;s only one result. I had waffled on this a little, but for predictability in scripting it really always needs to be a consistent format. So even a single-string result, e.g. a command that targets a single element with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--search</code> and then uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.source</code> in the query (which previously would have just returned the source string for the matched tag) will now return an array containing a single string.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;ve put a considerable amount of effort into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--query</code> feature. You can now use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jq</code>-like syntax to query multiple items in an array, use dot-syntax for attribute comparisons, and use comparisons (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^=</code>) on hashes, returning true if any value in the hash matches the query. Still, if you want the full power of something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jq</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yq</code>, you can just pipe the output to either and work with more familiar tools.</p>

<p>But on to a cool thing. I mentioned CurlyQ&rsquo;s screenshot capability in the intro post, but it&rsquo;s received some improvements, and I thought it deserved a little more detail.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I incorporated <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" title="Selenium">Selenium</a> to allow scraping of dynamic web pages. One of the features Selenium provides is screenshots saved from the browser of choice. Thus CurlyQ has a screenshot feature:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>curlyq screenshot -b 'firefox' -t 'full' -o 'screenshot_name' URL</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--browser</code> flag (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b</code>) determines whether it uses Chrome or Firefox, and the selected browser must be installed on your system. The full-page capture (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t full</code>) is only available with Firefox. Chrome can only output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visible</code> (the visible part of the page on first load) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print</code>, a print version of the page with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@media print</code> styling applied. Firefox can output all types.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--type</code> flag (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t</code>) accepts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visible</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print</code>. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t full</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b firefox</code>, you get a full-length version of the rendered page, including offscreen elements. All of these can be abbreviated to their first letter, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t f</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b c</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--output</code> flag (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-o</code>) is required and determines the path/name of the output file. Providing just a name will save the file to the current directory. Extensions can be provided but will be changed depending on output type, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.png</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visible</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print</code>. So you can just provide a name without extension and CurlyQ will apply the appropriate extension.</p>

<p>As a side note, saving a screenshot with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t print</code> will output a PDF with actual text that can be searched by Spotlight (and other tools). So you could ostensibly use CurlyQ to crawl an entire site (by parsing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">links</code> subcommand output and spidering) and save every page to a searchable PDF. I don&rsquo;t know offhand why you&rsquo;d do that, but it&rsquo;s possible.</p>

<p>CurlyQ is still being refined and your input is welcome. Join me on the <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">Forum</a>, or just message me on <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff/">Mastodon</a> with suggestions and bug reports.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m releasing an initial version of my latest tool, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/curlyq">CurlyQ</a>. It&rsquo;s a work in progress, though should be immediately useful to those who need it. I need your input on where it goes next, what&rsquo;s missing, and what you&rsquo;d like to do with it that it can&rsquo;t handle yet. Join me <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">in the forum</a> to discuss<sup id="fnref:comment"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:comment" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>!</p>

<p>CurlyQ is a helper for the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html">curl</a> command, with some extra functionality. Sure, it can grab the contents of a web page, but it can also provide a breakdown of all of the metadata, page images, page links, and can work with dynamic pages (where the page is loaded by a JavaScript call and the raw source is empty except for script tags). It will even do screenshots. It&rsquo;s designed to alleviate some of the chores when scraping web pages or getting JSON responses.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="a-scripters-tool">A Scripter&rsquo;s Tool</h3>

<p>CurlyQ is designed to be part of a scripting pipeline, making it as simple as possible to do something like get a page&rsquo;s title, find the largest image on the page, or examine and validate all the links on a page. You can query the results based on any attribute of the returned tag, showing, for example, only links with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel=me</code> attribute or a paragraph with a certain class. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tags</code> subcommand can output a hierarchy of all tags on the page, with each parent tag containing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tags</code> key with its immediate children, on down the line. This can be queried and filtered using command line flags.</p>

<h3 id="failure-prevention">Failure Prevention</h3>

<p>This tool has multiple User Agent strings configured and can accept custom headers. If a request fails, it will try again with various User Agent strings. This is because some sites block pages with certain (or missing) User Agents, and some don&rsquo;t, so it has a built-in retry. It can also handle pages that respond with gzipped data using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--compressed</code> on the command line. If you don&rsquo;t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--compressed</code> and it detects gzipped data, it will quietly fail and notify you that you need to add the flag. I may make this an automatic fallback in the future. You can also specify a browser as a fallback (Chrome or Firefox), so if regular curling fails or is blocked, it can actually load the page in a web browser and retrieve/process the source from the window.</p>

<h3 id="retrieving-page-elements">Retrieving Page Elements</h3>

<p>CurlyQ also incorporates Nokogiri, allowing it to perform element selection using CSS selectors or XPaths. For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> command accepts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--search 'article header h3'</code> to return an array of all h3s contained in a header tag inside an article tag on the page. It can output as JSON or YAML, and for queries that target a specific element or key in the response, you can output raw strings.</p>

<p>There are also tools for extracting content between two strings, returning an array of all matches on the page. The idea is that in cases where you need to extract content that might not be easily located with tags, you can provide before/after strings to extract the necessary information.</p>

<h3 id="ready-set-shoot">Ready, Set, Shoot</h3>

<p>CurlyQ can take several types of screenshots: full page (one long PNG), visible page (just the part of the page initially visible in the browser), or the print output, applying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@media print</code> stylesheets. It doesn&rsquo;t currently offer any type of image manipulation, but it might someday at least be able to create miniature versions (thumbnails) automatically.</p>

<p>The screenshot capability works best with Firefox. You can shoot the visible part of pages using Chrome, but to get full-page screenshots, Firefox is required. CurlyQ uses <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" title="Selenium">Selenium</a> to load up an instance of the selected browser and grab the rendered source or take a screenshot. The source is fed through the same processor as a regular curl call, so most aspects remain the same. The result is missing response header info, though. CurlyQ does not aim to be a full web automation tool, for that you&rsquo;ll want to get accustomed to using a headless browser in your scripting language of choice.</p>

<h3 id="json-handling">JSON Handling</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s very limited support for handling JSON responses. It currently only handles GET requests and allows you to specify request headers, returning response headers as well as the pretty-printed (optional) results of parsing the JSON, all as one JSON or YAML blob. It&rsquo;s assumed that you&rsquo;ll do any handling of the results using something like <a href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq">jq</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mikefarah/yq">yq</a>. It can cycle through User Agent strings to find one that works and elegantly return a response code and headers on errors.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next</h3>

<p>One major area that&rsquo;s missing right now is the ability to make requests other than GET. I would like to add POST capabilities, accepting data from command line flags or just passing it a JSON blob on STDIN or from a file. That&rsquo;s for the next version, though.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate feedback on this tool. If you have a use for something like it, but it doesn&rsquo;t do quite what you need, please list your use cases and expectations in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/curlyq/issues">Issues</a> on GitHub. I&rsquo;d love to flesh this out into an all-purpose web scraping tool.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/curlyq">CurlyQ</a> project page for more details on installation and usage. I look forward to your feedback (in <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">the forum</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/curlyq/issues">on GitHub</a>), positive or negative!</p>

<br /><br />总结: Lyrics插件现在可以嵌入来自Genius.com的JavaScript版本的歌词，包括注释。通过查询!lyricjs SEARCH STRING来使用。BrettTerpstra.com网站支持这个插件。 <div>
<p>Another silly little rabbit hole I&rsquo;ve gone down&hellip; The Lyrics plugin for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a> can now embed the JavaScript version of lyrics from Genius.com, complete with annotations.</p>

<p>The query is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!lyricjs SEARCH STRING</code>. Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!lyricjs Blood in the Cut K.flay</code> will output this:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'rg_embed_link_2835612'</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">'rg_embed_link'</span> <span class="na">data-song-id=</span><span class="s">'2835612'</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<title>Updated Bitlyize Service</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16509323/updated-bitlyize-service</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16509323/updated-bitlyize-service</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Bitlyize, Bit.ly API, shortened links, analytics, Ruby<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了对Bitlyize服务进行升级，使其能够与Bit.ly API v4兼容，实现长链接的解析和替换为与您的账户相连的短链接。此外，还介绍了如何获取Bit.ly的token并进行配置、安装Ruby等操作。文章还提到了Bitlyize服务的功能和下载包含的几种服务。同时，作者还提到了如何利用类似Alfred这样的应用进行服务操作，以及对于Amazon和iTunes链接的相关内容。 <div>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve had nice holidays!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve updated my Bitlyize service to work with v4 of the Bit.ly API. It parses the input for <em>all</em> URLs and replaces them with shortened links connected to your account. Not only can this make long links more readable, it gives you some analytics on how often the links are used (and deeper analytics like country of origin, referrer, and other data). If you pass it a Bit.ly-shortened  link, it will expand it to its original URL.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The downside to shortened links is you can&rsquo;t tell where they go, which can make them seem a little sketchy. You get to weigh the tradeoffs there. This service makes it easy to expand shortened URLs in place, though.</p>

<p>By the way, shortened links aren&rsquo;t just obscured for readers and recipients, they&rsquo;re opaque to future you as well. If you want to use short links for blogging or note taking, I recommend using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!bitly</code> function of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a>, which can give you title attributes. It requires separate configuration, but then instead of just a bit.ly link, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!bitly ++t Brett Terpstra project searchlink</code> and get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SearchLink](https://bit.ly/47lzuXS "SearchLink")</code>, which is a bit more descriptive. You can also just pass it a long url like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Marked 2.6.18](!bitly https://brettterpstra.com/2023/01/03/marked-2-dot-6-18-with-100-percent-less-jitter/)</code> and get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Marked 2.6.18](https://bit.ly/3ieHDcH "Marked 2.6.18 with 100% less jitter")</code>.</p>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>These Services require Ruby, which is no longer included with macOS by default. You can get it by installing the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/">Apple Command Line Tools</a>, or <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/macos/14-sonoma">see this article</a> for information on installing Ruby with Homebrew/ASDF. You don&rsquo;t need Rails or anything after the <em>Installing Ruby</em> section in the latter article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com#download">download the Service</a> below, double click to install, then set up a configuration file. The file should be located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/bitly/config.yaml</code> and only needs two settings:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">:token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>
<span class="s">:domain: 'bit.ly'</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get your token, log into your Bit.ly account. If you don&rsquo;t have one, you can create a free one. The whole point of using Bit.ly for this is to have trackable links, so you definitely need an associated account. Once logged in, go to <a href="https://app.bitly.com/settings/api">https://app.bitly.com/settings/api</a>. You&rsquo;ll see a field where you can enter your account password (the same one you logged in with), then click <strong>Generate Token</strong>.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="API Settings" class="aligncenter" height="1612" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/12/apisettings@2x.jpg" title="API Settings" width="1966" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>Assuming a correct password, you&rsquo;ll be presented with a long alphanumeric string. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll copy into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:token:</code> setting in your config file.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="Access Token" class="aligncenter" height="239" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/12/accesstoken.jpg" title="Access Token" width="637" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:domain:</code> setting is for users who&rsquo;ve set up a custom domain. If you haven&rsquo;t, you can just leave this set to &lsquo;bit.ly&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Once configured, just select any text containing at least one valid URL, run Services-&gt;Bitlyize (either from app menu or by right clicking) and give it a couple seconds to contact the API.</p>

              </video>
            </figure>

<blockquote class="info">
  <p>If you&rsquo;re curious about how I&rsquo;m running Services these days, as shown in the movie above, that&rsquo;s an app called <a href="https://appmakes.io/paletro" title="Command Palette in any applications">Paletro</a> that gives you a command pallete in any app. Available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>This Bitlyize Services will swap whatever type of link its passed, so if your text contains both long and short URLs, the long ones will be shortened and the short ones will be lengthened. If your text contains a mix of short and long urls and you want them all to be either shortened or lengthened, use  the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shorten</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Expand</code> Services individually.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>The download includes a few services, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bitlyize</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bitlyize to Clipboard</code>, as well as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bitly Shorten</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bitly Expand</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bitly Preview</code>. The base Bitlyize Service will auto-detect link type and either shorten or expand them. The Clipboard version simply outputs the result to the clipboard rather than trying to paste it, so you can use it on selected text in non-editable fields. The Shorten/Expand versions will only shorten or lengthen, rather than swapping whatever type is detected. The Preview version is designed to run on a single shortened link and show you a preview of the lengthened version for verification/safety before clicking a short link.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>If you want quick previews of multiple urls, shortened or long, I recommend my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions/#checkurls">CheckURLs PopClip Extension</a>.</p>

  <p>This version no longer adds affiliate codes to Amazon and iTunes links. iTunes doesn&rsquo;t really pay out anymore, at least for apps, and Amazon has their own URL shortener that I haven&rsquo;t figured out a way to tap into programmatically yet.</p>

总结: 
插件开发人员在明尼苏达度过温暖的圣诞节，创建了一个快速插件，用于检索指定地点的天气信息。插件支持通过邮编或城市名和州名来获取当前地点的天气情况。除了当前天气外，还可以显示当天的小时预报。该插件使用了代码以及API密钥，可以展示实时天气数据，并且可以自定义温度显示格式。搜索类型可以用缩写形式，而且该插件的开发过程也展示了SearchLink的可扩展性。 <div>

<p>It&rsquo;s unseasonably warm for Christmas here in Minnesota. It&rsquo;s 50° out. To mark the weird occasion, I created a quick plugin for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a> that lets you run a search like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>!current 55987</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And get:</p>

<p>Weather for Winona, Minnesota on 2023-12-25 at 12:53 PM: 51.8 and Light rain</p>

<blockquote class="alert">
  <p>The plugin only outputs &lsquo;embed&rsquo; style, it won&rsquo;t provide a URL for your forecast. It&rsquo;s just meant to inject actual weather data in your writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can input a zip code or city name and region/state and it will give you the current conditions for that location.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a version that gives you the hourly forecast for the current day as Markdown table:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>!forecast winona, mn</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<p>Forecast for Winona, Minnesota on 2023-12-25: Moderate rain 53.7/48.7<br />
Currently: 51.8 and Light rain</p>

<table>

      <th>10am</th>

<hr />

<p>This uses code from <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a>, and isn&rsquo;t meant to be overly detailed or comprehensive, just an easy way to include the current weather in whatever you happen to be writing. Silly, I know, but I already had most of the code.</p>

<p>To use the plugin, grab the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.rb</code> file <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins/blob/main/weather.rb">from the GitHub SearchLink Plugins repo</a> and place it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/searchlink/plugins/weather.rb</code>. Then you&rsquo;ll need an API key from <a href="https://weatherapi.com">https://weatherapi.com</a>. Just sign up for a free account and go to <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/my/">https://www.weatherapi.com/my/</a>. You&rsquo;ll see your API key at the top. Add that to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.searchlink</code> config file like so:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">weather_api_key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>
<span class="na">weather_temp_in</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">f</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather_temp_in:</code> setting, which can be &lsquo;c&rsquo; or &lsquo;f&rsquo; to get your temps in your local format. Then just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!current</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!weather</code> searches using a zip/city name as the search terms. Enjoy!</p>

<blockquote class="info">
  <p>The search type can be shortened to 3-4 characters, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!current</code> can just be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!cur</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!forecast</code> can just be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!for</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!fore</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!weather</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!wea</code> also work for current conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just another example of how extensible SearchLink is. If you&rsquo;re interested in creating your own plugins for <em>any</em> kind of search, <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Plugins">it&rsquo;s pretty easy</a>! By the way, I added a couple new classes, <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/blob/main/lib/searchlink/curl/html.rb"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Curl::Html</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/blob/main/lib/searchlink/curl/json.rb"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Curl::Json</code></a> which make it <em>super</em> easy to retrive an HTML or JSON response from a given URL and extract tags/title/data from them.

<div> 关键词: Ruby, macOS, 转码, 数字舍入, URL 编码

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了使用Ruby进行自动化和字符串操作脚本的技巧，包括转码、检查macOS、获取macOS版本、数字舍入、人类可读的文件大小、URL 编码等。这些技巧对于想要成为Ruby脚本程序员的人非常有用。还分享了一个剪贴板预览的壳函数，方便在任何shell中使用。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">

<p>I do most of my automation and string manipulation scripting using Ruby. I know it&rsquo;s not the most popular language these days, but it&rsquo;s the one I know the best (thanks to my days of hacking on TextMate bundles) and it&rsquo;s usually the fastest way for me to solve a problem. I have reams of snippets saved (and easily accessible with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/" title="Snibbets">Snibbets</a>) and thought I&rsquo;d share a few that are useful for everyday scripting on macOS.</p>

<!--more-->

<h4 id="scrub">Scrub</h4>

<p>Scrub uses the encode function to switch a string to UTF-16 discarding invalid characters (gremlins), then back to UTF-8. Applied as a String method, you can then use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input.scrub</code> to get clean text with all gremlins removed.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">String</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">scrub</span>
    <span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'utf-16'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">invalid: :replace</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'utf-8'</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">scrub!</span>
    <span class="n">replace</span> <span class="n">scrub</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="check-for-macos">Check for macOS</h4>

<p>This can be modified or turned into a case statement to determine operating system. I often only need it to check if I can run Mac-only tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pbcopy</code> or not.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="sb">`uname`</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strip</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"Darwin"</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="get-macos-version">Get macOS version</h4>

<p>Just in case your script needs to behave differently across OS versions:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">macos_version</span>
  <span class="k">begin</span>
    <span class="sb">`sw_vers`</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strip</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each_line</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strip</span> <span class="o">=~</span> <span class="sr">/ProductVersion:\s+([\d.]+)$/</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="no">Regexp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_f</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
  <span class="k">rescue</span>
    <span class="nb">warn</span> <span class="s1">'Failed to retrieve macOS version'</span>
    <span class="no">Process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">exit</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="rounding-numbers">Rounding numbers</h4>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Numeric</span>
  <span class="c1"># Round to nearest 5</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">round5</span>
    <span class="p">((</span><span class="nb">self</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">round</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="c1"># Round to nearest 10</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">round10</span>
    <span class="p">((</span><span class="nb">self</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">round</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="human-readable-file-size">Human-readable file size</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#to_human</code> method will convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">293592035</code> to &ldquo;280MB&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Numeric</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">to_human</span>

        <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\.?0*$/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">units</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">expand_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">ARGV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])).</span><span class="nf">to_human</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="url-encoding">URL encoding</h4>

<p>I used to use the CGI library for url encoding, but it doesn&rsquo;t properly percent-encode spaces as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%20</code>, but rather as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>, which breaks a lot of applications. The solution (as opposed to doing a manual search and replace) is to use the ERB library instead:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'erb'</span>
<span class="no">ERB</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Util</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">url_encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'string to encode'</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="get-a-single-keypress">Get a single keypress</h4>

<p>For dialogs where you want to act as soon as a key is pressed without requiring pressing Return:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_keypress</span>
    <span class="nb">system</span> <span class="s2">"stty raw -echo"</span>
    <span class="no">STDIN</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">getc</span>
<span class="k">ensure</span>
    <span class="nb">system</span> <span class="s2">"stty -raw echo"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
    
<span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_keypress</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chr</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="get-the-longest-string-in-an-array-of-strings">Get the longest string in an array of strings</h4>

<p>Of limited utility but I use it all the time when doing search algorithms:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Array</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">longest_element</span>
    <span class="n">group_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:size</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">max</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="c1"># Leave off the [0] to get an array containing all of the longest elements when there's a tie</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'short'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'longest'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'longer'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">longest_element</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; "longest"</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="symbolize-hash-keys">Symbolize hash keys</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re creating nested hash objects that end up with a mix of string and symbol keys, the easiest thing to do is symbolize all keys. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#to_sym</code> won&rsquo;t do anything if the key is already a symbol.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Hash</span>
  <span class="c1"># Turn all keys into symbols, including nested hashes</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">symbolize_keys</span>
    <span class="n">each_with_object</span><span class="p">({})</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">hsh</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">hsh</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_sym</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">is_a?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Hash</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">symbolize_keys</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># &gt;&gt; h = {'one' =&gt; 2, 'two' =&gt; { 'three' =&gt; 4 } }</span>
<span class="c1"># &gt;&gt; h.symbolize_keys</span>
<span class="c1"># {</span>
<span class="c1">#   :one =&gt; 2,</span>
<span class="c1">#   :two =&gt; {</span>
<span class="c1">#     :three =&gt; 4</span>
<span class="c1">#   }</span>
<span class="c1"># }</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope that&rsquo;s useful for aspiring Ruby scripters. If there&rsquo;s interest, I can post (tons) more, but I also hope to get better about creating Gists that could be more easily searchable as a reference. The next step for Snibbets?</p>

<h4 id="bonus-tip-clipboard-preview">Bonus tip: Clipboard Preview</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s a shell function I use frequently, easily replicable in any shell. It just shows you the contents of your clipboard (assuming text) without requiring a paste:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>pbpaste | cat</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Fish that looks like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code># Defined in /Users/ttscoff/.config/fish/functions/cbp.fish @ line 1
function cbp --description 'ClipBoard Preview'
  pbpaste | cat
end</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like I said, useful in any shell as a way to ensure what you think is on your clipboard actually is. Just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cbp</code> and get a preview before pasting anywhere.</p>

<div> 键绑定，多重按键组合，PLIST，Markdown，快捷键<br />
<br />总结:
本文介绍了如何利用多重按键组合来创建自定义的键绑定。作者使用了PLIST文件来定义不同的键绑定，并且可以进行多级嵌套，使得可以创建具有逻辑和记忆性的键盘快捷键。这种方法可以大大扩展可用的快捷键组合，同时也提高了使用效率。文章还提到了Markdown命令的多级嵌套例子，进一步展示了这种方法的灵活性和实用性。建议读者可以查阅作者的博客以获得更多灵感。 <div>

<p>Ok, this one will probably wrap up this little run of key binding tricks. It&rsquo;s been fun, though, and I&rsquo;d love to answer any questions I can in <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">the forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever examined <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/">my master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code></a> (or even looked at the readme), you&rsquo;ll see that I make use of a lot of multi-stroke key combos. There are only so many key combinations available, and you&rsquo;re bound to run out of ones that don&rsquo;t conflict with other shortcuts on your system. But with the magic of multi-stroke bindings, you can take one available shortcut and add secondary &ldquo;child&rdquo; shortcuts with the whole keyboard available for assignment again.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For example, the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a> bindings I use start with <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Command-G"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">G</kbd></span>. So I press that, then I can type a single letter to determine what type of SearchLink syntax gets inserted, e.g. <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Command-G"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">G</kbd></span> followed by <span class="keycombo combined" title="M"><kbd class="key symbol">M</kbd></span> inserts an IMDB search.</p>

<p>To create a mutli-stroke binding, you just nest a PLIST inside of the root PLIST, keyed off the initial key combination:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{
"^@g" = { // SearchLink commands
    // IMDB Search
    "m" = (setMark:, moveRight:, insertText:, " ", deleteToMark:, insertText:, " [", moveLeft:, deleteBackward:, moveRight:, yank:, moveLeft:, insertText:, "](!imdb)", moveRight:, deleteBackward:, moveLeft:);
 };
}</code></pre></div></div>

            </figure>

<h3 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h3>

<p>You can actually continue nesting, creating three-or-more -stroke sequences, though I don&rsquo;t know how many of those I could keep track of. Mnemonics do make it easy, though. I use a three-deep setting for my Markdown link insertions, where I type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Command-W"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">W</kbd></span> (the container for most of my Markdown commands, a throwback to the Blogsmith Bundle for TextMate), then <span class="keycombo combined" title="L"><kbd class="key symbol">L</kbd></span> (for link), then either <span class="keycombo combined" title="C"><kbd class="key symbol">C</kbd></span> (to paste from clipboard), or <span class="keycombo combined" title="T"><kbd class="key symbol">T</kbd></span> to insert just the brackets with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://</code> selected in the url.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{
  "^@w" = { // Multi-stroke Markdown commands
    "l" = { // Markdown link
      // create a link for selected text, cursor between () `[selected text]([cursor])`
      "t" = (setMark:, moveRight:, insertText:, " ", deleteToMark:, insertText:, " [", moveLeft:, deleteBackward:, moveRight:, yank:, moveLeft:, insertText:, "]()", moveRight:, deleteBackward:, moveLeft:, setMark:, insertText:, "https://", selectToMark:); // link text
      // create a link for selected text, inserting clipboard as url `[[cursor]selected text](clipboard contents)`
      "c" = (setMark:, moveRight:, insertText:, " ", deleteToMark:, insertText:, " [", moveLeft:, deleteBackward:, moveRight:, yank:, moveLeft:, insertText:, "](", setMark:, pasteAsPlainText:, insertText:, ")", moveRight:, deleteBackward:, moveLeft:, selectToMark:); // link with clipboard
    };
  };
}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These sequences open up pretty much limitless possibilities for memorably (mnemonic) keyboard shortcuts. You create a logical grouping on an open shortcut, and then assign single letters that are meaningful and easy to remember in context. These nested keystrokes can also use modifier keys, but I like the fact that once I&rsquo;m inside of the main grouping, I only need single letters and not weird key combinations.</p>

<p>As always, check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/">KeyBindings project</a> for more inspiration. Have fun!</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/" title="KeyBindings">keybinding week</a> this week. I&rsquo;ve talked about the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/12/18/macos-keybinding-tricks-the-kill-ring/">kill ring</a> and <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/12/19/macos-keybinding-tricks-the-repeat-count-binding/">repeat binding</a>, but I&rsquo;ve been digging in and revamping my own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file, so I keep wanting to share some of the cooler things it can do because I know the file in the project is pretty massive and hard to parse.</p>

<p>There are a ton of text editing shortcuts in my bindings (that&rsquo;s basically their sole purpose), but I wanted to highlight just a few that I use so often I don&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="textmate-command-return">TextMate Command-Return</h3>

<p>First, <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span>. TextMate was the first place I ever saw this, but now it&rsquo;s pretty standard in most text editors, from Byword to nvUltra, VS Code to Sublime. When you hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span>, it moves your cursor to the end of the current line/paragraph and inserts a new line, no matter where you are in the paragraph. And <span class="keycombo combined" title="Shift-Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span> will do the same but <em>before</em> the current line/paragraph. It allows you to be editing in the middle of a graf, then just hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span> to start typing again, saving use of the mouse or arrow keys to get to the new insertion point.</p>

<p>This keybinding will work in any Cocoa text field on your Mac, so it&rsquo;s no longer limited to your favorite coding app. It works in TextEdit, Mail, Pages (but not Word), and in apps like Bear, Day One, or NotePlan. Just about anywhere that uses native text fields.</p>

<p>The first version I&rsquo;ll show you is the most universal. The reason for this is that <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span> is frequently used by apps for special purposes, and the app&rsquo;s keybindings will override your system-wide keybindings. So having a less-common shortcut makes this more available. I actually include both versions in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dict</code> file, and when I&rsquo;m in an app that overrides <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span>, I just switch to using this version.</p>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>I use <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-O"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">O</kbd></span> for these, but note that doing so will mean you can&rsquo;t just type the slashed-O symbol (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ø</code>) anymore<sup id="fnref:slashedo"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:slashedo" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you never type that symbol, then you&rsquo;re fine, but if you do use it, you might want to consider a different shortcut.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To use any of the examples in this post, you&rsquo;ll just add them to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code>, a directory and text file you can create if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. The examples include the outer curly brackets, but if you&rsquo;re adding to an existing set of keybindings, only copy the portion inside of the curly brackets and place it within the existing outer curly brackets in your file.</p>

  <p>If you&rsquo;re combining multiple examples from this post, you only want one set of curly brackets at the root, and then the contents can be appended within those curly brackets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the bindings using <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-O"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">O</kbd></span> as the shortcut:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{
// blank line after current (Option-O)
"~o" = (moveToEndOfParagraph:, insertNewline:);
// blank line before current (Option-Shift-O)
"~O" = (moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, moveLeft:, insertNewline:);
}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here are the same bindings using <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{
// TextMate Command-Return (Command Return)
"@\U000D" = (moveToEndOfParagraph:, insertNewline:);
// Insert blank line above paragraph (Command Shift Return)
"@$\U000D" = (moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, moveLeft:, insertNewline:);
}</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>Remember that any time you edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file, you have to restart open apps for the new bindings to be recognized.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="moving-lines-around">Moving lines around</h3>

<p>This is another binding that&rsquo;s quite common in more advanced editors: the ability to move the current line up or down, and to increase/decrease indentation. In Sublime Text these are bound to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Command"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd></span>-Arrow keys. I use the Sublime bindings in VS Code, so I&rsquo;m not sure what they are there by default. But It&rsquo;s <em>so</em> nice to have these in any app, you can bind them to whatever shortcuts make sense to you. They won&rsquo;t override the native bindings in your favorite apps, so you can duplicate whatever you use most.</p>

<p>With these installed, you can be anywhere in a paragraph and move the entire graf up and down, and back and forth. In keybinding terminology, a paragraph is any text that has a line break or BOF at its start, and ends in a line break. So in a Markdown unordered list, each list item is a paragraph.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{
// &gt; Line motion with arrow keys
// move line up (Control-Command-Up Arrow)
"^@\UF700" = (selectParagraph:, setMark:, deleteToMark:, moveLeft:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, yank:, moveLeft:, selectToMark:, moveLeft:);
// move line down (Control-Command-Down Arrow)
"^@\UF701" = (selectParagraph:, setMark:, deleteToMark:, moveToEndOfParagraph:, moveRight:, setMark:, yank:, moveLeft:, selectToMark:);
// indent line (Control-Command-Right Arrow)
"^@\UF703" = (setMark:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, insertText:, "\t", swapWithMark:, moveRight:);
// outdent line (one tab or char) (Control-Command-Left Arrow)
"^@\UF702" = (setMark:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, moveRight:, deleteBackward:, swapWithMark:, moveLeft:);
}</code></pre></div></div>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>Note that these bindings aren&rsquo;t very smart or context-aware. If you try to outdent a paragraph that&rsquo;s already at the left border, it will instead remove the first character. And it doesn&rsquo;t respect newlines between paragraphs very well, so if you have three paragraphs with newlines between them, and then attempt to move the last one to the second spot, you&rsquo;ll need to add back the newline after moving. Which is where the TextMate bindings above come in <em>super</em> handy.</p>

  <p>They also use a tab for indentation, which works great for outdenting lines that are indented with tabs. If, however, the indentation is spaces, the outdent binding will only delete one space at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re already used to Vim keybindings, you may want to try the same setup using <kbd>hjkl</kbd>. I&rsquo;ve found that these combinations conflict with a few different apps&rsquo; global shortcuts on my own system, but your mileage may vary. The arrow key version works everywhere for me, so this is just an example of alternative bindings.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{
// move line up
"^@k" = (selectParagraph:, setMark:, deleteToMark:, moveLeft:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, yank:, moveLeft:, selectToMark:, moveLeft:);
// move line down
"^@j" = (selectParagraph:, setMark:, deleteToMark:, moveToEndOfParagraph:, moveRight:, setMark:, yank:, moveLeft:, selectToMark:);
// indent line
"^@l" = (setMark:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, insertText:, "\t", swapWithMark:, moveRight:);
// outdent line (one tab or char)
"^@h" = (setMark:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, moveRight:, deleteBackward:, swapWithMark:, moveLeft:);
}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>HoudahSpot is a powerful tool for finding and managing files on your Mac, with features beyond Spotlight.</p>

<p>Have you shifted — by choice or by default — from organizing files in folder hierarchies to searching as your method of “filing?” You already appreciate the value of fast searches using macOS Spotlight. HoudahSpot is the next-level solution that fills the gaps in Spotlight’s functionality.</p>

<p>Are you tired of wasting your time searching for files on your Mac? When Spotlight falls short, HoudahSpot takes productivity to a new level. To put it bluntly, HoudahSpot is like steroids for Spotlight on macOS.</p>

<p>Think of HoudahSpot as an advanced, productivity-oriented version of Spotlight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search for files using by name, text content, kind, date, and other metadata</li>
  <li>Start and refine searches with just a few clicks</li>
  <li>Combine any number of criteria to narrow down the list of results</li>
  <li>Sort search results and assess relevance by author, image resolution, video length, etc.</li>
  <li>Preview file content and text matches in context</li>
  <li>Customize default search criteria, search locations, columns, and sort order to fit your workflow</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="houdahspot-tip-find-files-by-example">HoudahSpot Tip: Find Files “By Example”</h4>

<p>If you have found a file with similar properties to the files you need, you can use it to refine your search. Just drag that example file to the search pane to update the search criteria. For instance, suppose you are looking for the master file – a Photoshop, Affinity Designer, or similar file – used to create a JPEG image uploaded to your website. Chances are that both the master file and the final JPEG were last modified on the same date. Drag the JPEG to a “Modified” criterion in HoudahSpot’s search pane. Search criteria will update and limit search results to files modified on the same day as the JPEG.</p>

<p>Of course, the same idea works to prune excess results from your search results: Remove files that share a property with a file you know not to be relevant. You can, for example, drag the folder containing one of the search results to the location exclusion list. Your search results will no longer include files from the folder you deem irrelevant.</p>

<p>HoudahSpot is free to try. If you make use of search in your daily computer usage, <a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/index.html?utm_source=brettterpstra.com&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=hs_bt_2023_12" rel="nofollow">try HoudahSpot today</a>!

<title>macOS keybinding tricks: the repeat count binding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Vim, macOS, 快捷键, 重复操作, 文本编辑器<br />
总结:<br />
本文介绍了在macOS上利用快捷键来实现重复操作的技巧。通过设置特定的快捷键，用户可以在文本编辑器中使用数字来指定重复次数，从而提高编辑效率。同时，作者还分享了一些使用这一技巧的场景，以及一些注意事项。 <div>
<p>Another trick for readers interested in honing their keyboard-fu on macOS.</p>

<p>In Vim, most operations have can have a count specified in the keystrokes for the command, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3dd</code> to delete 3 lines. You can do similar in any Cocoa text field (all Apple apps, plus most native apps). You just need to specify a keyboard shortcut to use before the count. Then you can hit that keyboard shortcut, type a number (X) and then hit a key or key combination to have that event repeated X times.</p>

<p>To set the repeat shortcut:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>defaults write -g NSRepeatCountBinding -string "~r"</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above would set the repeat binding to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span>. Use the following shortcuts when defining the operator, being sure not to overwrite a keyboard shortcut you use elsewhere (control-option combinations are pretty safe):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Modifier</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>~</td>
      <td>Option</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>@</td>
      <td>Command</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>^</td>
      <td>Control</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$</td>
      <td>Shift</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can use any combination of symbols when defining your shortcut. I like <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~r</code>) because it has no conflicts that I know of and is easily reachable with my left hand. Also there’s a mnemonic quality with “r” for “repeat.” Choose whatever you like.</p>

<p>Once the above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaults</code> command is run, relaunch whatever app you want to test it in. It will work in TextEdit, nvUltra, Bear, Pages… most apps that you would use on your Mac. But a restart of the app will be required for the new bindings to be recognized.</p>

<p>Now, type your selected shortcut (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> if you didn’t change it), then type a number (any number of digits), then type “x”. If you typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;SHORTCUT&gt;10x</code>, you should get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxxxxxxxxx</code>. This works with both character insertions and movement keys and text operations. For example, if you type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;SHORTCUT&gt;5</code> and then hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-Delete"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9003;</kbd></span>, it would delete backwards 5 words. Each step of the repeat process is stored in the undo buffer, so undoing it would require five <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Z"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Z</kbd></span>s. This is actually a feature, because if you’re estimating how many words back to delete but guess wrong, you can undo a couple to restore them individually.</p>

<p>One niche example use for this is when you want to insert a redacted password or API key when you’re writing. You know the length of the password or key should be 20 characters, so you just type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20x</code> and get a string of x’s of the appropriate length. Or if you want to select the previous 3 words in the current line, just type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code><span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-Shift-Left Arrow Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#8592;</kbd></span>. Much like Vim, it takes a second of thought to figure out how many times you want to repeat an action, and in some cases it’s faster to just hit the key that number of times. But give it a go and make a conscious effort to use it for a while, I bet it will stick.</p>

              <video class="lazy" loop="" poster="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/12/repeat-binding.jpg">

              </video>
            </figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weirdly this trick doesn’t work for <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-V"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">V</kbd></span>, which is disappointing because one very common use I could see for it would be to copy something and then paste it X number of times. I can’t explain why that doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Hope that leads to some fun/increased productivity for folks willing to try it. If you have any favorite keyboard tricks, please feel free to share in the comments!</p>

<title>macOS keybinding tricks: The kill ring</title>

<div> Keybinding, macOS, Emacs, Clipboard manager, Terminal
总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了如何在macOS中使用键盘绑定技巧来增强文本编辑功能，包括使用Emacs风格的快捷键和创建剪贴板管理器。作者提到了如何在终端中创建一个“kill ring”来存储剪切的文本，然后通过编辑默认键绑定文件来创建新的功能。最后，作者建议读者在BrettTerpstra.com上查看更多相关内容。 <div>

              </noscript>
            

<p>So you may have seen my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/" title="KeyBindings">KeyBindings</a> project before. It’s an insanely large collection of keybinding tricks that work in any macOS text field. Well, any native cocoa field. You won’t have much luck in Electron or other non-native text editors. But for most uses, including in Safari, Mail, Notes, nvUltra, and most of the Markdown editors, the tricks work great. You can do things like adding TextMate-style <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span> to any editor to create a new line no matter where your caret<sup id="fnref:caret"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:caret" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (cursor) is in the line.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/topic/keybindings/">written a bit about all of this before</a> (and see the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/series/keybinding/">KeyBinding series</a>), but I’ll recap the basics for this tip, since it’s been a while. To wit, you can create a (plain text) file located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> that tells every macOS app what to do when you hit certain keys, and you can override all kinds of defaults and add new functionality by editing it. If that file already exists, you can just add to it. I’ll offer more details when we get to that part of the trick.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="emacs-keybindings">Emacs Keybindings</h3>

<p>You already have emacs-style shortcuts available, including <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span> to delete (kill) to end of line, <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-U"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">U</kbd></span> to delete to beginning of line, and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> to paste (yank) text that was cut using either of the kill commands. You can delete an entire line by hitting <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-A"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">A</kbd></span> (go to beginning of line) and then <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span>, then paste that line somewhere else with <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span>. Try it. You don’t have to do anything to enable this, it’s always been built into macOS. I think it also works on iOS, but I don’t have an external keyboard hooked up to test it out with right now. Let me know in the comments.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>Bonus tip: <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-T"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">T</kbd></span> will transpose the characters to the left and right of the caret, allowing you to easily change frutive to furtive with one keystroke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this tip is a way to make this cut/paste process more useful. You’ve probably used (or at least seen) clipboard managers before. I use <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar" title="LaunchBar 6">LaunchBar</a> for this, but there are plenty of apps like <a href="https://pasteapp.io/">Paste</a> that can do it. Basically every time you cut or copy something, it gets added to a list in your clipboard manager, allowing you to paste anything you’ve copied elsewhere, rather than just the last thing you copied. I wouldn’t want to function without one. Those apps don’t work with the kill commands, though. So here’s what you can do instead.</p>

<h3 id="create-the-kill-ring">Create the Kill Ring</h3>

<p>First, run this command in Terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>defaults write -g NSTextKillRingSize -int 6</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That creates a “kill ring” with 6 slots. Every time you cut, the text will be stored in the next available slot, cycling back to the beginning when the 6 slots are full. You can make that number anything you want, but be aware that to use items stored in the kill ring, you’ll have to cycle through them until you get to the one you want, and empty slots will still have to be cycled through. Which generally would mean pasting them all in a row, which is where the next part of the trick comes in.</p>

<h3 id="edit-the-keybindings">Edit the Keybindings</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If you already have a file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code>, open it in a text editor and add the keybinding inside of the main curly brackets that already exist in the file. If you don’t have that file, create a new, empty text file in your text editor of choice.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re working with an empty file, first insert a pair of curly brackets before inserting the text below. If you already have an existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file, then just add the following between the existing parent curly brackets:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>"^y" = (yankAndSelect:);</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file (as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> if it’s new).</li>
  <li>Running apps will need to be restarted to recognize the new keybindings.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this circumstance, “yank” means “paste” from the register, as opposed to the Vim vernacular where it means “copy” (which makes more sense 🤷🏻‍♂️). So now, pressing <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> (“^y”) will paste the next item from the kill ring, and immediately select it (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yankAndSelect:</code>), so pressing <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> again will overwrite what you just pasted with the next item in the kill ring. If there are registers in the kill ring that haven’t been filled yet, it will paste an empty string, but you can just keep hitting <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> to cycle back around to where your populated registers are.</p>

<blockquote class="error">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The kill ring is shared between documents in the same app, but generally not between apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To try it out, restart your text editor (if it was running when you changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file) and write several lines of text in a text field:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>this is line 1
this is line 2
this is line 3
this is line 4</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Put your caret at the beginning of each line and press <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span>, once for each line (use arrow keys and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-A"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">A</kbd></span> to get to each line start). Then, put your caret anywhere and type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> repeatedly. You should see your cut lines pasted and replaced in place. Note that these commands do register in the undo buffer, so if you cycle past the one you wanted, you can usually use <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Z"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Z</kbd></span> to go backwards through the list. The kill ring is <abbr title="Last In First Out">LIFO</abbr>, so you’ll get your results in the reverse order you added them to the ring.</p>

<title>Ruby Regexp::scan with MatchData</title>

<div> 关键词: Ruby, 字符串处理, 正则表达式, 匹配, 方法

Ruby编程语言中有许多字符串处理方法，通过正则表达式进行匹配和扫描是常见的操作。作者在文章中分享了如何通过组合使用match_scan和matches方法，将正则表达式匹配的结果转换成包含各项值的哈希数组。这种方法可以方便地从字符串中提取想要的数据，极大地简化了字符串处理的复杂度。这对于正在学习Ruby脚本编写的初学者来说是非常有用的技巧。 <br /><br />总结: Ruby编程中的字符串处理和正则表达式匹配可以通过match_scan和matches方法简化，让数据提取更加方便和灵活。 <div>
<p>This post will only be of interest to people writing scripts in Ruby. Seriously, zero utility if you’re not using Ruby. Though I would be curious how you accomplish the same thing in other languages like Rust and Python, because I’ve never gotten too deep with string manipulation in anything other than Ruby, Swift, and Objective-C. If you care to leave a comment with pointers, I’m all ears.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I do a lot of string manipulation in Ruby. One of the things that always gets me is that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regexp::match</code> method returns groups but only matches the first instance. To match all instances for enumeration, you have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regexp::scan</code>. But <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scan</code> doesn’t include groups (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchData</code>). So a while back I figured out the solution, and I thought I’d share it for any aspiring Ruby scripters.</p>

<p>The trick is to map scan results and replace each result with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regexp::last_match</code>, which includes groups (and named groups) from the last regex that was run. Thus:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_enum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:scan</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">regex</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">Regexp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last_match</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>results in an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchData</code>. Then you can iterate through it and use indexes or group names to pull out particular groups of each match.</p>

<p>I’ve combined this with a few other methods to create a general string handling routine that I use regularly.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c1"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>

  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the above methods available, you can do something like:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="n">str</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;~</span><span class="no">EOEMAILS</span><span class="sh">

  Ford Prefect &lt;perfect@example.com&gt;
  Zaphod Beeblebrox &lt;zaph@example.com&gt;
  Mrs. Alice Beeblebrox &lt;zaphsfav@example.com&gt;
  Slartibartfast &lt;fjordmaster@example.com&gt;
  Marvin the Paranoid Android &lt;planetbrain@example.com&gt;
</span><span class="no">EOEMAILS</span>

<span class="n">rx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sr">/(?&lt;prefix&gt;\S+\. )?(?&lt;first&gt;.*?)(?:( (?&lt;middle&gt;\w+\.?))*(?: (?&lt;last&gt;[\w-]+)))? &lt;(?&lt;email&gt;.*?)&gt;/i</span>

<p>Running that results in:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:prefix</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>That’s a silly example, but hopefully you can see the utility of turning a regular expression into an array of hashes containing the individual values of each match extracted by scanning the string.</p>

<p>I decided to make a “Brett’s Favorites 2023” part 2. I missed a few things in the first list. This will be a shorter post, but should cover some gaps I left in <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/12/08/bretts-favorites-2023/">the first one</a>.</p>

<h3 id="apps-i-missed">Apps I Missed</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://timingapp.com/" title="Timing Automatic Mac Time Tracker">Timing</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Timing every day for keeping track of how I spend my time on my computer (and my iPhone). When I start a new project, at the end of the day I open up the main window and add rules by dragging and dropping relevant files and keywords, so time spend on that project is automatically tracked moving forward. I even made <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/doing/2.1.84/Doing/TimingImport" title="www.rubydoc.info">an importer</a> for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/" title="doing - BrettTerpstra.com">Doing</a> that combines my time tracking with my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What Was I Doing?</code> file.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://noteplan.co/" title="noteplan.co">Noteplan</a></dt>
  <dd>I got back into Noteplan in the latter half of 2023. I love the idea of combining my notes and brainstorming with scheduling, todos, and time blocking. All using Markdown. It’s a beautiful idea and superbly executed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="a-little-fiction">A Little Fiction</h3>

<p>I read a ton in 2023, mostly via audiobooks. So “read” might be a stretch, but I do love audiobooks. I won’t list everything I’ve read here, but a couple of standouts:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1941539416/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="Flux by Jeremy Robinson">Flux by Jeremy Robinson</a></dt>
  <dd>I read so many books from Jeremy Robinson this year. He weaves excellent sci-fi stories. Also check out <a href="https://amzn.to/3GAM6Py">Infinite</a>. The twists are insidiously satisfying.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3uSAIMx">In the lives of Puppets by TJ Klune</a></dt>
  <dd>There’s a space for queer Sci-Fi, and TJ Klune does an amazing job of occupying it. This book takes the idea of a future dominated by robots and few (one?) remaining human and makes it a truly heartwarming journey. Thanks to Jesse Darst for cluing me into this one.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="therapuetic">Therapuetic</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1683646681/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="No-Bad-Parts-Restoring-Wholeness">No Bad Parts by Richard C. Schwartz</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve been doing a lot of therapy this year and only recently discovered Internal Family Systems, which has been a game changer. I won’t explain the psychology of it here, but if you want to learn more about the parts of you that might prevent you from being your true self, definitely check this out. I bought the e-book version for my Kindle, but also bought the audiobook version for its guided meditations.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/47MjoHq">What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma</a></dt>
  <dd>This was the year I realized I had Complex PTSD, and I did a lot of reading around it. This one serves more as a memoir than a treatment plan, so take it along with some actual therapy. A lot of hope here, though.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://overtiredpod.com/">Overtired</a></dt>
  <dd>The Mental Health Corner on Overtired means a lot to me. I get to share my journey through CPTSD, ADHD, and Bipolar, as well as hear from people who go through very similar things to me. It’s kind of its own version of therapy (though it can’t replace actual therapy.) If you have issues of your own, you’ll probably be able to relate to me, Christina, and Jeff as we share. I recommend checking it out.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/487Xluz">The Wicked Healthy Cookbook</a></dt>
  <dd>If you’re vegan or aspiring to be, this book is a must-have. Truly delicious food and techniques that even a non-vegan can appreciate. I’m pescatarian for the time being, but cooking without meat, dairy, or (in my case) gluten means I’m always looking for recipes that actually taste amazing but fit my diet.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3taVJBw">The Vegan Chinese Kitchen</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve been into Chinese cooking lately, and it’s pretty easy to make it vegan. I also recommend <a href="https://yeungmancooking.com/products/yeung-man-cooking-cookbook-signed">Yeung Man Cooking</a> (also available as <a href="https://yeungmancooking.com/products/yeung-man-cooking-cookbook-ebook">a digital version</a> for $20), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YEUNGMANCOOKING">the author has a YouTube channel</a> worth checking out.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://misen.com/products/pre-seasoned-carbon-steel-pan">Misen Carbon Steel Pans</a></dt>
  <dd>I have been through countless non-stick pan solutions over the years. I long for the convenience, but nothing seemed to stand the test of time. Our trusty cast iron pan outlasted all of them by miles, and with <a href="https://amzn.to/3Gz96OW">a good chain mail scrubber</a><sup id="fnref:chainmail"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:chainmail" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, they’re very easy to care for. Then I tried carbon steel pans and have decided that that’s the way forward. They become more non-stick over time as a a natural result of material and seasoning, rather than quickly losing some chemical coating and becoming a stickier mess than your typical aluminum pan. I admit I’m awful at properly caring for non-stick pans, which is why I needed a solution that just got better the more you used it (and could handle high heats). Misen has always impressed me, and their carbon steel pans have proven to be an excellent solution.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://store.177milkstreet.com/products/milk-street-nakiri">Milk Street Nakiri</a></dt>
  <dd>My favorite chef’s knife is still <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nh8Fg3">my Misen</a>, but this “vegetable knife” is pretty amazing. It’s a great form factor, and I love it. If you want to spend about half as much, there are <a href="https://amzn.to/4acfs4s">plenty of similar options</a>. I can vouch for the Milk Street one, though. Lightweight, sharp, textured blade for gripping between thumb and forefinger.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3GC0HdK">Tumbler Diamond Rolling Knife Sharpener</a></dt>
  <dd>I <em>love</em> a sharp kitchen knife, but have never been great at sharpening myself or sending my knives off for professional sharpening. That’s why I jumped on this when I discovered it, and it’s been 100% worth the investment. Definitely get <a href="https://www.tumblerware.com/collections/all/products/tumbler-leather-strop">the strop</a>, too.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="other-hardware">Other Hardware</h3>

<p>I said I didn’t buy a lot of hardware this year, but I dug through my Amazon purchases and found the stuff that I actually love.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3t87M2y">Elgato Stream Deck Pedal</a></dt>
  <dd>I’m all in on Elgato stuff, from my <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nf4VvC">Wave XLR</a> to my multiple <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXHL5DMD/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="Elgato-Production-Controller-Streaming-Customizable">Stream Decks</a>. But what was missing was buttons for my feet, and the Stream Deck Pedal has filled that gap nicely. I tried a few other, cheaper USB pedal solutions before I gave in and purchased this, and I’ll tell you that nothing else works as well. Whether you need a cough button, control over your Twitch stream lighting, or just want to be able to launch an automation with your foot, it’s a lot of fun.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3GArAic">Minoston Z-Wave Outlet Mini Plug-in Socket</a></dt>
  <dd>I’m only dipping my toes in Homekit, with a lot of hope for Matter, but for now my home automation is mostly Insteon and Z-Wave. These little plugs have made automating the Christmas lights I use for warming up various rooms super easy.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3Rgk94n">Tineco Pure ONE S15 Pet Smart Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</a></dt>
  <dd>I was a big fan of Dyson stick vacuums, but they kept breaking on me. Too much maintenance. So I decided to try something new. This one has been excellent. I’ve been using it for about 6 months and have only had to clean it once. Plus I love/hate the little headlight it has on it; I love it because it helps me see all the grit I’m picking up, but I hate it because it makes it obvious when I’m going too fast.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:chainmail">
      <p>Wait, you didn’t know about chain mail? You can scrub the living hell out of a cast iron (or carbon steel) pan with chain mail and it won’t destroy the seasoning or cause any rusting. If you like heavy cookware, you need one of these. Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> use it on a non-stick pan. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:chainmail">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Welcome to my yearly post about stuff I’ve loved in the last year. I love doing this because it reminds me how amazing the Mac/iOS app ecosystem is these days. I can’t list every app I use in this post, it would take forever, but I can highlight some of the outstanding ones. I’m going to do this all in one epic post this year. It’s going to get long. You could always use <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/" title="Gather CLI">Gather</a> to convert it to Markdown, and then make use of all of <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked’s</a> navigation tools 😇.</p>

<p>Apps available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a> will be noted. As I mention frequently, Setapp is a great deal at $10/month for 200+ excellent apps. If you’re a Setapp user, you should always try to use the Setapp version of your favorite apps to make sure the developer gets a piece of your subscription! If you’re not, you should seriously consider signing up. <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">This link</a> gives me a little kickback when you join!</p>

<p>The categories are presented with items in no particular order. I could have made them alphabetical, or attempted to rank them, but no, I present you with an unorganized stream of consciousness. Welcome to the inside of my head.</p>

<h3 id="the-old-but-awesome-stuff">The Old But Awesome Stuff</h3>

<p>I’m going to quickly list some repeats that are still favorites here at the top. These are apps I’ve used for years and still rely on every day, but I’ve talked about them plenty and you’ve probably heard about them before. So just a quick list of my perennial favorites.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/" title="Powerful File Search Tool for Mac">HoudahSpot</a></dt>
  <dd>Find everything on your Mac, even the stuff that Spotlight misses.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.toketaware.com/" title="toketaWare">iThoughtsX</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>My favorite mind mapping tool. All the power and flexibility you need without becoming a chore to use. This one is on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">giveaway list</a>, so stay tuned for that next year!</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.zengobi.com/curio/" title="Note Taking, Mind Mapping, Brainstorming">Curio</a></dt>
  <dd>The ever-evolving brainstorming/project management tool that continues to amaze. Watch for a giveaway coming soon (New Year’s Day!).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://1password.com/downloads/" title="Best Password Manager for Apple iOS Devices">1Password</a></dt>
  <dd>With the new Passkey and Authenticator possibilities in 1Password, it’s a no-brainer for me. I’ve trusted it for years and it’s never let me down.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://folivora.ai/" title="folivora.ai-Great Tools for your Mac!">BetterTouchTool</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I talk about BetterTouchTool all the time. Maybe too much. But it’s the most amazing automation tool I’ve found. Second place for me is <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/" title="Keyboard Maestro 11.0.2:Work Faster with Macros for macOS">Keyboard Maestro</a>, which just got a new version (v11) in the last few months.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://freron.com/" title="MailMate">MailMate</a></dt>
  <dd>The stalwart email app for Mac that I depend on. Customizable shortcut keys, plugin architecture, Markdown capabilities… I’ve never found anything close.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://choosy.app/" title="Choosy:A smarter default browser for macOS">Choosy</a></dt>
  <dd>Choosy is long in the tooth but still working great. Instead of opening a link in your default browser, you can pop up a selection of any browser on your system, and you can create rules for handling different types of links with specific browsers.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/" title="Simply Useful Software">Hazel</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Hazel every day, but I don’t even think about it most of the time. It just sits in the background, managing my files and doing crazy automations when I give a file a certain naming pattern or put it in a certain folder. For example, if I save an image to my desktop with a name like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brettsfavorites2023@2x%%r1600ohc.png</code>, Hazel will (r)esize it to 1600px width, (c)onvert it to JPEG, create a (h)alf-size 1x version, and (o)ptimize the images. Then I just drag the results to a <a href="https://aptonic.com/" title="Aptonic-Dropzone 4">Dropzone</a> target to have them added to my blog and an image tag for the pair placed in my clipboard.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" title="Take control of your Menu bar">Bartender</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>Without Bartender my menu bar would be out of control. But with it, I can hide all of the menu bar icons I don’t need all of the time, and quickly access them with a hotkey search.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/" title="www.stclairsoft.com">Default Folder X</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>Early in the Sonoma release DFX stopped working for me (all fixed now), and I didn’t realize exactly how dependent on it I was until it wasn’t there anymore. Save and open dialogs on your Mac need this.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.popclip.app/" title="PopClip for Mac">PopClip</a></dt>
  <dd>I use PopClip all day, every day. It pops up a menu every time you select text with your mouse. The available extensions are outstanding, and I have my own <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions/" title="Brett's PopClip Extensions">custom actions</a>, too. One example is my URL Preview extension, so when I use SearchLink to grab a URL for an app I’m writing about but I’m not sure the result is correct, I just select the url and click the preview button in the popup. I get a tiny little web browser floating over my text, and if it’s the correct link, I hit escape and go back to writing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://textexpander.com/" title="TextExpander:#1 Text Replacement &amp; Keyboard Shortcut App">TextExpander</a></dt>
  <dd>You hear about TextExpander every month when they sponsor this blog, so it makes this quicker list. It’s another app that, on the occasion it stops working, so do I. I don’t even remember how to type some of the things it makes automatic for me. One example is sending nvUltra beta invites. I just hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> to reply to an email request, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,,nvub</code>, and have an email with all of the necessary links and info ready to send. Or I can generate a new license for <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,,mlic</code>, and TextExpander will use the Paddle API to make me a license and insert all of the text I would send to explain how to use it. And I just linked that reference to Marked by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/m</code>. Infinite possibilities.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/" title="www.taskpaper.com/">TaskPaper</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I have a TaskPaper file in every project folder, and I use tools like <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code></a> to quickly manage them from the command line. But nothing beats opening up the actual TaskPaper app for speedy task management and ease of use with lots of keyboard shortcuts.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://hookproductivity.com/" title="Links beat searching">Hookmark</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve preached the Hookmark gospel a lot here. Their recent improvements to the “bookmarking” concept (plus the Pinboard integration) have made this an invaluable tool for keeping my projects together. I have this post linked to a few web pages, my nvUltra notes on it, and the Markdown versions of previous installments of my Favorites series for reference. I just hit my shortcut key and navigate between them with ease.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="newish-stuff">New(ish) Stuff</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus" title="Task Management Software Built For Pros-OmniFocus">OmniFocus 4</a></dt>
  <dd>The latest version of OmniFocus is a major revamp of the app. I don’t think it will be available in time for this post to go up, but let me at least tease it by saying if you love OmniFocus already, you’re going to love v4, and if you’ve disliked it in the past for any reason, it’s time to give it another look. An honorary mention here goes to <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" title="To-Do List for Mac &amp; iOS">Things</a> — the latest version is a top-notch app, especially if OmniFocus just feels more powerful than you need.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.corecode.io/macupdater/" title="keep all your apps up-to-date effortlessly">MacUpdater</a></dt>
  <dd>This app has quickly become one of my day-to-day favorites. It keeps all of my apps up-to-date without me having to deal with download/install prompts every time I launch them. See the release notes for an update if you want to, install available updates with a single click, and always have the latest and greatest versions of apps ready to run. It auto-scans for updates in the background, so you don’t even have to remember to check it to keep everything updated.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/" title="Ivory for iOS">Ivory</a></dt>
  <dd>I’m all in on Mastodon, and all out on Twitter. And Ivory is my favorite Mastodon client on both Mac and iOS. It does everything I need it to, beautifully. If you ever enjoyed TweetBot, this is kind of that, but for Mastodon.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://tailscale.com/download" title="Download">Tailscale</a></dt>
  <dd>What a great tool. I hook it up to my GitHub account and then every device on my network is accessible through a private VPN from anywhere in the world. I have it running on all of my Macs, my iPad, and my Synology, and I can get direct access to any device without any additional hassle.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" title="Git Diff and Merge Tool and Text Comparison—Kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a></dt>
  <dd>Kaleidoscope has made huge bounds in functionality this year. It was already my diff tool of choice (on any platform), but they’ve added new integrations, debugging features, and awesome support for Git history and merging. (Full disclosure, Kaleidoscope has sponsored this blog. This opinion is unpaid!)</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.descript.com/tools/transcription" title="Reliable, Simple &amp; Free Video &amp; Audio Transcriptions">Descript</a></dt>
  <dd>I can’t imagine making podcasts without Descript anymore. It does fairly reliable transcriptions, but the real magic is that you can edit the podcast by editing the text of the transcription. Makes it easy to search for parts you remember need an edit, remove filler words, and add things like chapter titles and cover art to make a ready-to-publish MP3.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://appmakes.io/paletro" title="Command Palette in any applications">Paletro</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I think I’ve mentioned this one before, but if you like command palettes in your favorite editor (e.g. <span class="keycombo combined" title="Shift-Command-P"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">P</kbd></span> in Sublime), this adds the same concept to any app on your Mac. Hit the keyboard shortcut and every menu item (including Quick Actions and Services) are instantly available via keyboard.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screens-5-vnc-remote-desktop/id1663047912">Screens</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Screens all the time for connecting to my various Macs, especially the mini that runs headless in my basement. Versus the Screen Sharing tools in macOS, it adds Screens Connect, which helps you connect to known machines from anywhere, stored credentials, and curtain mode, which masks the display of the remote Mac you connect to. Clipboard sharing, display selection (when there are multiple montiors), and easy drag-and-drop file transfers make it a pretty seamless experience.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/dato" title="Dato — Sindre Sorhus">Dato</a></dt>
  <dd>I can’t use <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical" title="flexibits.com">Fantastical</a> with my work calendar, unfortunately (if I could, I’d be using that). But Dato works with my calendar, shows a great summary of calendar events in my menu bar, and makes joining a Zoom call a one-click process from either the menu bar or the notifications it provides. Solid tool that I use daily.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/" title="award-winning photo editing software">Affinity Photo</a></dt>
  <dd>The Affinity apps continue to blow me away, and I use Affinity Photo almost daily. It completely replaced Photoshop for me a couple of years ago. Honorable mentions to <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/" title="Full Featured Photo Editor for the Mac">Acorn</a> and <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch 2, from Flying Meat">RetroBatch</a> from Flying Meat for regularly helping me with my image processing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="macOS Terminal Replacement">iTerm</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve tried all the terminal apps that have been popping up. <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" title="Warp:Your terminal, reimagined">Warp</a> is great, for sure. But I always come back to iTerm. It got so many of the special features right that it feels like all the other developers are just trying to keep up with it.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/" title="Loopback:Cable-Free Audio Routing">Loopback</a></dt>
  <dd>I love Rogue Amoeba (also a previous sponsor), and Loopback is an amazing tool for audio routing. If you, like me, have multiple audio inputs and outputs, it makes creating virtual devices for them (or any combination of them) a drag-and-drop affair. For example, I use my Echo Dot for playing Spotify music, and route it through my Komplete 6 as a secondary input. I created a Loopback device that combines that secondary input with my main computer audio and adds the ability to mute the device using the media keys.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/" title="Structured &amp; focused writing app for Mac">Bike</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>Bike is a new entrant this year. I generally think in mind maps, but there’s always a place for a solid outliner. I used to use Tree, but it fell into disrepair, and Bike is coming along nicely. As you would expect from Hog Bay Software, the query tools and automation capabilities are receiving lots of love. Plus the file format is just text (HTML, to be precise) and your outlines can be used anywhere. Much like TaskPaper, it’s easy to automate using command line tools, but more fun to work with inside the app.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://retina.studio/textbuddy/" title="TextBuddy">TextBuddy</a></dt>
  <dd>I love TextBuddy so much. It does everything you want to do with text, from wrapping/unwrapping, escaping, translating, converting tabs to spaces, even reading text from images and working with it. And it does it elegantly with keyboard shortcuts. No buttons to hit, just paste your text (or send it via Service shortcut), hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-T"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">T</kbd></span> and type to find the conversion you want to run. It’s even extensible with JavaScript, and can also run your favorite Services (like <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a>!).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://devutils.com/" title="DevUtils-All-in-one Toolbox for Developers">DevUtils</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>This is another new one to me. It’s a collection of simple tools a developer would make use of, such as url encoding, JSON formatting/validation, JSON/YAML conversion, Unix Time converter, and dozens of others. It can detect what type of data is on your clipboard when you click its menu bar icon, offering an accurate guess of which tool(s) you’ll need to handle it. It can also copy straight back to clipboard, so some things are simply a matter of copying text, clicking the icon (global and Service shortcuts available), and pasting the result.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.git-tower.com/" title="The most powerful Git client for Mac and Windows">Tower</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve mentioned Tower before (also a previous sponsor), but it’s come a long way this year. One of the most ingenious features is the undo command (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Z"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Z</kbd></span>) that can undo literally any Git operation. You know, the ones that usually require filtering through the reflog and making cherry pick commits to fix. It makes using Git a pleasure, and taps into all of the powerful features it offers, just with drag and drop instead of command line futzing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://cleanshot.com/" title="CleanShot X for Mac">CleanShot X</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I mentioned this one last year, but I would be remiss not to let you know how much I love it again. CleanShot X is one of the most useful and elegant utilities on the Mac right now. For all your screenshot needs, including things like automatic email pixelation and annotation, it just can’t be beat.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>

<p>I haven’t found a lot of new stuff on iOS that I love this last year, but mostly because I primarily use my phone for email, messaging, and gaming. There are a few standouts in my daily use, though.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-ai-email-inbox/id997102246?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Spark Mail + AI: Email Inbox">Spark</a></dt>
  <dd>Spark gets a mention as my favorite email client. I haven’t sprung for the premium features, I find that the base package does everything I need it to. Smart inbox, easily configured sidebar, snoozing, pinning, and great search. Combined with <a href="https://try.sanebox.com/ttscoff" title="SaneBox—Email Management for Any Inbox">SaneBox</a> (sponsor) and MailMate on my Mac, I’m quite happy with my email management system.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finity/id1071698434?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="finity.">Finity</a></dt>
  <dd>Rabbi Eric Linder introduced me to this game and it did the impossible task of replacing Threes, my all-time favorite waiting room game. It’s an infinite puzzle that you’ll never beat, but it’s so much fun to play.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grindstone/id1357426636?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Grindstone">Grindstone</a></dt>
  <dd>Grindstone is still one of my favorite games. Even though I’ve 3-starred all the levels, they offer daily challenges with worldwide leaderboards that keep me coming back.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artifact-feed-your-curiosity/id1572927568?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Artifact: Feed Your Curiosity">Artifact</a></dt>
  <dd>Apple News hasn’t impressed me that much lately, but Artifact is a constant source of headlines I actually care about, across multiple categories. And the AI-generated summaries are great. It will even rewrite headlines to be less click-baity if enough people report them.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/night-vision-lidar-scanner/id1668629667" title="Night Vision - LiDAR Scanner">Night Vision</a></dt>
  <dd>I don’t use this app as often as the others, but I like the concept. It makes your iPhone’s LiDAR camera available as a kind of night vision camera, allowing you to see objects in complete darkness. Handy for stumbling through the house at night when you can’t sleep but don’t want to wake anybody up.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>I apparently didn’t buy much other hardware this year, and my list is pretty much exactly the same as last year’s. <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2022/12/31/bretts-favorites-2022-hardware/">Check it out here.</a> I will mention my UHK, though:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a></dt>
  <dd>My perennial favorite keyboard, and I got the V2 this year with box white switches, wooden wrist rests, and the new thumb modules. I’ve gotten a few other people on board with this one and haven’t heard about anybody being disappointed with the purchase. I’m typing on it right now and loving it. UHK recently released the <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/product/riser60">Riser 60</a>, a mechanism for getting steeper tenting (two halves raised in the middle). Ordered mine immediately, just waiting for it to ship!</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="personal-projects">Personal Projects</h3>

<p>I did a lot of coding this year. My bipolar has been stable for the last 6 months, so I’m taking a healthier-than-usual approach to coding. No all-night coding binges, just steady improvements of some of my favorite tools.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a></dt>
  <dd>SearchLink is a child who takes care of me in my old age. I put a lot of love into it, and it works to make my life easier. If you haven’t seen it, it makes writing a post like this one a cinch. I haven’t switched over to my browser once since I started writing. I just give it text like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Kaleidoscope](!s +mac)</code> and hit the keyboard shortcut, and it inserts a link (with title attribute) to the app in question. Works for dozens of search types. I recently added back <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/11/05/searchlink-gets-google-search-back/">Google searching using the API</a> (as opposed to scraping DuckDuckGO, though that’s still available), and my results are 99% correct on the first try.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">NA (Next Action)</a></dt>
  <dd>I made a lot of progress on NA this year, converting it to a gem, adding the ability to update and modify tasks, and improving overall performance. As I mentioned above, I use TaskPaper-formatted files in every one of my projects to track bugs, todos, and feature requests, and NA makes working with those files from the command line easy and fun.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://marked2app.com/" title="Smarter tools for smarter writers">Marked 2</a></dt>
  <dd>Marked didn’t see as much innovation as usual this last year, but it continues to do what it does very well: previewing Markdown and exporting HTML and beautiful PDFs. Multi-document features, writing tools, regex searching, bookmarking in long documents… it does it all. The biggest challenge this year was updating for Sonoma, which broke significant parts of Marked.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a></dt>
  <dd>Bunch got a ton of love early this year. It’s been stable for a few months now, almost every feature request handled and all bugs squashed (that were squashable). It’s received coverage on multiple sites and even print write-ups in  a couple of magazines. I’m pretty proud of it as a project, and think it fits nicely into the Mac automation space.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a></dt>
  <dd>mdless was my most recent coding obsession, and probably my last one for the year. It previews Markdown on the command line, outputting formatted text to your terminal. Perfect for reading those README files after you clone a project! Combined with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/" title="Gather CLI">Gather</a> (a previous coding obsession this year), it can actually work as a Lynx-style browser.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://nvultra.com/" title="nvUltra-Searchable, portable, MultiMarkdown notes">nvUltra</a></dt>
  <dd>I know, I know. It’s so close. The beta is very, very stable, we’re just working on a couple of refinements (and some MAS purchase issues) before release. If you’re reading this and you’re not on the beta already, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">contact me</a> to get added.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Well, that’s my wrap-up for 2023. Hopefully you found some gems along the way.

<title>mdless with document transclusion</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16484987/mdless-with-document-transclusion</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16484987/mdless-with-document-transclusion</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> MultiMarkdown, transclusion, file, include, path
<br /><br />总结:
最新版本的编码工具包含了MultiMarkdown，并且增加了文件引入的功能。通过使用双大括号插入另一个文件的内容，路径可以是相对或绝对路径，还可以在元数据中指定transclude base。这个功能对大部分用户来说可能并不是非常有用，但对一些用户来说会非常方便。 <div>
<p>The latest version of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a>, my most recent coding obsession, now includes MultiMarkdown <a href="https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/transclusion.html">document transclusion</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File transclusion is the ability to tell MultiMarkdown to insert the contents of another file inside the current file being processed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can include a document by inserting a relative path between two pairs of curly brackets:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{{myfile.md}}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The path is relative to the current document, which won’t work if you’re piping text to mdless. In that case it would need to be an absolute path, or have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transclude base</code> specified in the metadata.</p>

<p>To provide a base for transclusion paths, just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transclude base</code> to your document’s metadata, either as MultiMarkdown metadata, or as a YAML header:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>transclude base: ~/Documents/myproject/chapters</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s probably not a super useful feature to 90% of mdless users, but should be handy for some.</p>

<title>mdless gets all the colors</title>

<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16477495/mdless-gets-all-the-colors</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 改进，主题，颜色代码，TaskPaper渲染，更新日志<br />
<br />总结: 该文章介绍了mdless 2.1.6版本的更新，包括使用十六进制颜色代码进行主题设置，解决了列表和段落中颜色显示的问题，改进了TaskPaper的渲染和自动检测功能，并新增了显示更新日志的--changes标志。 <div>
<p>I just pushed v2.1.6 of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless, terminal markdown viewer">mdless</a>. Once all these 2.0 changes are confirmed to be stable, I’ll let this project go for a while, but right now there’s lots to improve on and I’m enjoying it as a way to blow off steam.</p>

<p>The biggest change in 2.1.6 is the ability to use hex codes when theming. If you didn’t know, the first time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> is run, it saves a theme file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/mdless.theme</code>. You can <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/#customization">edit this file</a> to change what colors different elements display as. You can also create additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NAME.theme</code> files and trigger them with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--theme NAME</code>, or set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:theme:</code> setting in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/config.yml</code>.</p>

<p>With the latest version, you can use 3 or 6-digit RGB codes in addition to color names. Where previously you were limited to the default ANSI colors like red, blue, magenta, cyan, etc., you can now insert something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eccc87</code> where a color name would usually go. You can affect background colors by prefixing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on_</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bgeccc87</code>. The depth of color that can be displayed depends on your terminal, but at minimum this opens up 256 colors for theming, a 32x increase in options.</p>

<p>I also fixed a couple of issues where span elements in list items would cause the coloration to change. And when there’s a space between list items, they get rendered as paragraphs <em>within</em> list items (standard for most Markdown parsers), causing the coloring to be unexpectedly the same as regular paragraphs. Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> strips out regular paragraph coloring on paragraphs contained in list items, so every paragraph within a list gets the list item coloring.</p>

<p>In TaskPaper rendering, documents will now respond to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--list</code> to list projects, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--section</code> to list just certain project(s) contents. These no longer have to be numeric (for Markdown or TaskPaper); fuzzy text matching can pick a section (or multiple sections) for you. I also improved the TaskPaper auto-detection by adding a routine that removes all lines that match project or task regular expressions, and if there’s nothing left, it assumes it’s a TaskPaper document. Let me know how this works in the real world.</p>

<p>Lastly, I added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--changes</code> flag that will display the changelog (using mdless for readability), so when you update you can see what changed just by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless --changes</code>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless, terminal markdown viewer">project page</a> for the full changelog and more details!</p>

<p>Thanks to SaneBox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! Instead of a monthly sponsored post this month, the good folks at SaneBox have decided to join my giveaway series and offer 5 free 1-year subscriptions to SaneBox to BrettTerpstra.com readers. Just sign up below for a chance to win.</p>

<p>If you somehow haven’t heard of SaneBox yet, it’s a service that keeps your email inbox clean. You can train certain types of emails to go to your @SaneLater folder, or any custom folder, just by moving an email once. Future emails like it will automatically go to that folder. Forget setting up complicated filters and rules, a week of training and you’ll have a clean inbox that contains only the messages you actually need to see. I especially love the @SaneBlackHole feature which lets me banish certain senders to a, well, black hole, where their messages disappear and I don’t have to go through any hassle of unsubscribing or requesting data removal to stop the incoming messages.</p>

<p>Sign up below for a chance at one of 5 1-year subscriptions, a $299 value. Winners will be drawn next Wednesday, December 6th.</p>

              </noscript>
            

<p>I made a few major updates to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/">mdless</a> 2.0 (<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/11/23/mdless-2-dot-0/">first announced a couple days ago</a>) over the holiday weekend. Note that you can make all of the new options permanent in the config file (see <a href="https://brettterpstra.com#updateconfig">Easily Update Config</a>). Options specified on the command line will always override anything in the config file, so you can disable options permanently but enable them on a per-run basis using command line flags.</p>

<h3 id="inline-styling">Inline Styling</h3>

<p>The first problem I ran into was that if a link, emphasis, or other inline element came in the middle of a line, everything after that element would fail to be styled. So I added in a routine that I created for Doing that can take the text preceding an element and determine what the escape sequence would be at the end of that text, right before the new element. Then I can restore that sequence after the new element.</p>

<h3 id="nested-lists">Nested Lists</h3>

<p>Second, and this was a real pain, nested lists weren’t working. Like at all. I didn’t notice it at first because my test files had very basic lists in them, but lists were being flattened, ordered list sequencing was completely out of whack, and nested paragraphs and code blocks within lists were getting totally borked. Fixing this was a pain. Redcarpet only provides “text” and “type” to the list rendering functions, so you have no idea if it’s nested, at what level, etc. You can start a class variable counter and increment it with each ordered item, but as soon as it nests or starts a new list, you’re in trouble, and lists aren’t rendered in sequence anyway, so an array structure to keep track of them is impossible. They’re rendered inside out, so any kind of basic counter will be off as soon as you have a nested ordered list. Fixing this took me three days, and I went through a dozen solutions before one worked. I think the current solution is pretty solid, seems to handle all of the aforementioned issues and maintain accurate numbering with multiple nested, ordered lists. Also indents paragraphs and code blocks within lists.</p>

<p>I am running into an issue where a numbered item can sometimes have an unnecessary line break after it. I haven’t yet been able to track down where that’s coming from. Also, nested code blocks are indented, but one less indent than their parent list item. These will be fixed in future releases.</p>

<h3 id="taskpaper-highlighting">TaskPaper highlighting</h3>

<p>I also added TaskPaper highlighting to mdless. You can run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--taskpaper true</code> to force TaskPaper highlighting, or run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--taskpaper auto</code> to detect TaskPaper formatting either from the file extension or test whether it has at least 1 project and 6 total tasks between projects based on regular expressions. Not the most elegant way to detect it, I’m sure, but it seems to work well in my testing. You can add:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="s">:taskpaper: :auto</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/config.yml</code> to make auto a permanent setting (or use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> to force it either way).</p>

<p>If TaskPaper highlighting is enabled, no other Markdown processing will be done. TaskPaper formatting intersects with Markdown formatting in ways that can cause unpredictable results. So @tags and values are highlighted, project names are highlighted, and task markers get colored. Other than that, it’s just displayed as is.</p>

<h3 id="reference-link-formatting">Reference Link Formatting</h3>

<p>As mentioned in an update to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/11/23/mdless-2-dot-0/">2.0 announcement</a>, mdless can now render links as inline, reference, or reference-per-paragraph, grouping the references below the paragraph or element that refers to them. Just run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--links paragraph</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--links reference</code> to enable either, and these can be made permanent in the config file by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:links: :reference</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:inline</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:paragraph</code>).</p>

<h3 id="emphasis-markers">Emphasis Markers</h3>

<p>The initial release hid the markers around emphasis, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**bold**</code> would just render as <strong>bold</strong>, applying colors from your theme but leaving out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**</code> surrounding it. That’s now configurable in the theme settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>emphasis:
  bold: b
  bold_character: "**"
  italic: u i
  italic_character: "_"
  bold-italic: b u i</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can leave the character settings empty to not display any characters at all (as per previous behavior).</p>

<h3 id="other-markdown-rendering-options">Other Markdown Rendering Options</h3>

<p>Redcarpet has flags available for lax spacing (requiring newlines around HTML blocks) and intra-emphasis (where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a_underscored_filename</code> would get rendered with italics in the middle). Disabling intra-emphasis means that underscored filenames (and other words) stay as is.</p>

<p>These can be implemented in mdless using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]intra-emphasis</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]lax-spacing</code>, and both options can be made permanent in the config file.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="s">:lax_spacing: </span><span class="no">true</span>
<span class="s">:intra_emphasis: </span><span class="no">false</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="wiki-links">Wiki Links</h3>

<p>This one is simple, I just added highlighting for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[wiki links]]</code>. It can be toggled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]wiki-links</code> and uses the colors specified for link brackets and link text. Make it permanent with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:wiki_links: true</code>.</p>

<h3 id="updateconfig">Easily Update Config</h3>

<p>By the way, you can overwrite the config file with current command line flags and any new keys that have been added by running with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--update-config</code>. Any other flags on the command line will be set in the config, and any new keys that may have been added since your config file was created will be added with their default values.</p>

<p>The config file is found at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/config.yml</code>. Options specified there can be overridden by using command line flags at any time. This file is automatically written on the first run where the file doesn’t exist, so you can scrap preferences and start again just by deleting the file and running mdless (any command line options used on that first run will be set in the config file, otherwise the default value for each option will be used).</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pad numbers on headline listing to preserve indentation</li>
  <li>Image rendering with chafa improved, still have to figure out a way to make sure content breaks properly around the embedded image</li>
  <li>Only detect mmd headers on first line</li>
  <li>Scrub invalid UTF-8 in document to remove characters that break regexes</li>
</ul>

<div> Markdown, mdless, update, terminal handling, code highlighting

更新了mdless至2.0版本，进行了完全改版，采用了新的Markdown解析方式，并且加入了自定义渲染和前后处理。表格清理效果更好，脚注可以更灵活地显示在段落后或者末尾。代码高亮更加准确，有序列表也可以正确显示编号。整体来说，是一个很大的进步。如果你在终端里使用Markdown并花费时间在README文件上，可以试试使用mdless来代替打开浏览器或者编辑器预览。详情和安装指南请参考链接。 <div>

<p>I’ve updated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> to 2.0. Well, 2.0.5 at this point. It’s a complete overhaul of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">the command line Markdown parser/viewer</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a pretty popular project, and is being used on all kinds of OSs, but it got frustrating as the whole thing was based on regular expressions for parsing and users expected it to handle some more complex markup than it could. So for the reboot, I switched to using <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">RedCarpet</a> for parsing, then added my own terminal handling to that via a custom renderer and pre/post processing.</p>

<p>Table cleanup is better than ever. Footnotes can still be displayed directly after the paragraph that references them, or at the end of the display. Code highlighting (with <a href="https://pygments.org/" title="Welcome!—Pygments">Pygments</a>) is more accurate than ever. Ordered lists are properly numbered, regardless of the numbering in the Markdown. There are a few differences in the way things like code blocks nested in lists are displayed (they’re no longer indented), but overall it’s a big step up.</p>

<p>If you’re into Markdown and spend time in the Terminal, let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> display those README files for you, rather than opening up a <a href="https://marked2app.com">dedicated viewer</a> or editor with a preview. See <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">the project page</a> for more details and installation instructions.</p>

<p>Review versions of text and image files—and even folders full of files—with the world’s most powerful file comparison app. <a href="https://kaleidoscope.app">Kaleidoscope</a> gives you powerful tools to use at each stage of the development cycle.</p>

<p>The brand new <strong>Kaleidoscope 4.3</strong> continues to innovate by improving the previously introduced <strong>Git Merge Context Shelf</strong> and <strong>Git File History</strong>. Kaleidoscope now also detects file renames and shows branch names. When used with a service such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, Kaleidoscope now supports jumping to commits, branches, and tickets referenced in commit messages. And it beautifully renders Markdown content in commit messages, which makes browsing and comparing commits so much nicer.</p>

<p>Here are some of the features we added in Kaleidoscope 4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax coloring, with multiple built-in themes.</li>
  <li>Transform any comparison into a merge document that can be edited inline.</li>
  <li>Text filters to clean up diffs by removing irrelevant data, such as time stamps, object addresses and unique identifiers.</li>
  <li>Kaleidoscope Prism, a new helper app in the menu bar to quickly launch comparisons even if Kaleidoscope is not running.</li>
  <li>Debugger integration for Python developers.</li>
  <li>File properties show metadata, including size, file type, dates, and encoding.</li>
  <li>A welcome window that speeds up the processes of creating new comparisons or finding recent ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subscriptions start at $8 per month for a yearly plan. Use the coupon code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code> (valid until December 31, 2023) to get 20% off for the first year. As a student or teacher, the price is reduced even further.</p>

<title>Halp: Universal help for Fish</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16436713/halp-universal-help-for-fish</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16436713/halp-universal-help-for-fish</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Fish, help, command, function, editor<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了作者将自己的通用“help”命令移植到了Fish上。通过使用halp命令，用户可以方便地获取命令的帮助信息，无需考虑帮助信息来自哪个渠道。作者还提到了安装该函数的方法，以及如何编辑该函数以适应用户需求。此外，作者还分享了一个有用的Fish函数，可以让用户使用自己喜欢的文本编辑器编辑Fish函数。最后，作者鼓励读者查看他的公共Fish函数，并邀请他们点赞或分享这篇文章。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="Post banner" class="aligncenter" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2020/04/gonefishin-rb.png" title="Post banner" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>I’ve had it out there for a while, but I thought I’d point out that I’ve ported my universal “help” command to Fish. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">halp</code> removes the hassle of figuring out whether a command’s help comes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man CMD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help CMD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD -h</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type CMD</code>. Just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">halp CMD</code> (where CMD is the command you want help on) and it will figure out the rest.</p>

<p>To install the function, just save the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/blob/master/functions/halp.fish">halp.fish</a> file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/fish/functions</code>. Once there, you can just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">halp CMD</code> to get an appropriate help screen, whether it has a man page, a help page, command line help, or is an alias or function. By default it’s set up to use <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash" title="Dash for macOS-API Documentation Browser, Snippet Manager">Dash</a> for Fish native commands (rather than opening your browser), but you can edit the function to change that (see the comments). That requires that you’ve installed the Fish docset (Dash Preferences-&gt;Downloads-&gt;User Contributed). My local version of the function also replaces the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man $cmd</code> line with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open "dash://man%3A$cmd"</code> to open man pages in Dash (requires the manpage docset). Edit as needed to make it work for you.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you regularly edit Fish functions, it can be handy to use your favorite text editor rather than Vim or the internal editor. I have a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funcsubl</code> that wraps the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funced</code> command with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subl -w</code> and autosaves after closing the window. You can modify this to work with any editor, you just need a “wait” flag (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subl -w</code>). Here’s <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/blob/master/functions/funcsubl.fish">my version</a>.</p>

<p>Check out all my public Fish functions in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/tree/master">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<title>SearchLink gets Google Search back</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16429946/searchlink-gets-google-search-back</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16429946/searchlink-gets-google-search-back</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Google, API key, searches, SearchLink, DuckDuckGo 
<br /><br />
总结: 
Google现在再次提供API key来进行搜索，每天免费搜索限制为100次。用户可以将自己的API key添加到配置文件中，以便在搜索时使用Google的功能。如果当天用完了100次搜索，系统会自动切换回之前的DuckDuckGo搜索配置。使用Google进行搜索不会引起新的隐私问题，因为这些搜索不包含任何追踪数据。SL.ddg()方法在使用插件时也会测试是否存在API key，并且在可用时将使用Google。用户需要安装最新版本的SearchLink，并生成自己的API key。 <div>
<p>So it turns out Google now offers <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction">an API</a> (once again). It’s limited to 100 searches per day for the free version, so I don’t want to put my API key into the public distribution of SearchLink, but if you want to tap into Google’s power for your searches, you can now add your own API key to the config and get 100 searches per day for free. If you should, for whatever reason, run out of searches in a day, it should gracefully switch out to the previous DuckDuckGo configuration.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!g</code> search will now test for the presence of a Google API key, and if it exists, use Google for the search. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!gg</code> to force a Google search. If there’s not a key set up, it will continue operating as it has using DuckDuckGo. As far as privacy concerns go, these searches don’t include any tracking data, so using Google in this manner shouldn’t present any new issues. For anyone creating plugins, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SL.ddg()</code> method will also test for an API key and use Google if available.</p>

<p>To use this, install the latest version (download below) and then see the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Using-Google-Search">wiki page I created</a> to generate your own key.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Tower’s mission is simple: to make Git easy and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

<p>All the features of our native Git client have been carefully crafted with this specific goal in mind. Here are five examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Undo any Git operation by simply pressing CMD+Z (or CTRL+Z on Windows). This convenient keystroke allows you to easily roll back any mistakes made.</li>
  <li>Use Drag and Drop to efficiently reorder commits, cherry-pick, merge/rebase branches, or create pull requests.</li>
  <li>Solve merge conflicts easily with Tower’s Merge Wizard, which provides clear context about the conflict.</li>
  <li>Review your repository’s branches with Tower’s “Branches Review” feature. This feature helps identify stale branches or those that have already been fully merged.</li>
  <li>Enable Syntax Coloring to quickly identify changes made in every diff. Tower supports almost 200 languages, making it easy to spot differences in code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the world’s best software teams use Tower every day - on both macOS and Windows.</p>

<div> teleprompter, iOS/Mac, web version, Alfred workflow, Notes, console.table()

总结:
teleprompter是一个简单的概念，但很多人都搞砸了。Teleprompter Premium是我最喜欢的iOS/Mac应用，同一开发商刚刚发布了一个网络版。它的价格比我预期的要高一些，但在11月3日之前注册可以获得终身50%的折扣。

很高兴看到新版本的Alfred workflow开始流行。它可以基于模板文件创建新项目。

我必须承认，Notes已经成为了一个强大的应用程序。我从来没有想到苹果会对它进行如此多的开发。

我终于明白了console.table()的实用性。

Backblaze可以安全地将您整个计算机备份到云端，价格实惠可靠。我非常信任它来保护我的所有数据。 <div>

<title>Searchlink, not just for searching</title>

<div> SearchLink, plugins, text filter, calendar, MakeADate.
总结:
SearchLink是一个用于链接网站、应用程序页面、Gist嵌入以及其他博客、网页写作或展示注释的工具。文章介绍了如何安装和贡献插件，并提供了一些示例代码。此外，还介绍了几种可以使用SearchLink的插件，包括MixCase（用于随机大写字符）、Calendar（插入Markdown日历）、MakeADate（插入格式化日期）。该文章鼓励读者通过查看提供的代码，生成自己的插件，并鼓励分享。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">

              </noscript>
            
<p>First, I’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins">repo for SearchLink plugins</a>. This is mostly going to be example code, but you might find some useful ones in there. If you’ve never checked out SearchLink and do any kind of writing that requires linking to web sites/pages, app landing pages, Gist embeds, or basically any kind of blogging, web writing, or show notes, you should <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins">plugin repository</a> for details on installing and contributing. All of the available searches in SearchLink are defined as plugins, so you can also <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/tree/main/lib/searchlink/searches">use those as examples</a>.</p>

<h2 id="text-filters">Text Filters</h2>

<p>One thing I wanted to explore was using SearchLink for more than just searches. I created a couple proofs of concept as plugins. Some of these make more sense as TextExpander snippets, but I wanted to experiment, so here’s what I came up with.</p>

<h3 id="mixcase">MixCase</h3>

<p>This plugin is a text filter that will turn <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!mix A string of text</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A STRInG of TExT</code>, randomly capitalizing characters. It’s just to demonstrate how easily a text filter can be implemented (if you know a little Ruby, anyway).</p>

<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>

<p>Another example of a text filter. This one can insert a Markdown calendar for any month and year. You can define the month and year like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!cal 5 2024</code> to get a calendar for May, 2024. If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!cal now</code> it will insert a calendar for the current month and year. It can also print how many days are in a month with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!days 2 2024</code> to show how many days are in February in 2024. Silly, and again would probably be better as a TextExpander snippet, but I’m just experimenting with extending SearchLink.</p>

<h3 id="makeadate">MakeADate</h3>

<p>This is a port of a TextExpander snippet I use. It takes a natural language date and inserts a formatted date. It provides the following formats:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Abbr</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!ddate tomorrow 8am</code></td>
      <td>2023-11-02 8:00am</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dshort 2/2/24 6:30am</code></td>
      <td>2024-2-2 6:30am</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!diso tomorrow 1pm</code></td>
      <td>2023-11-02 13:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dlong tomorrow 8am</code></td>
      <td>Thursday, November 2nd, 2023 at 8:00am</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All of the searches can be abbreviated to two letters, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!diso</code> becoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!di</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dlong</code> becoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dl</code>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>This plugin requires that PHP be installed on the system, either with the Apple Command Line Utilties (I think), or with Homebrew (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install php</code>).</strong></p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>Use the fully-commented code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lyrics.rb</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Plugins">documented in the SearchLink wiki</a>) to generate your own plugins, and reference <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/tree/main/lib/searchlink/searches">the existing searches</a> for inspiration. Feel free to fork and submit a PR to <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins">the plugin repository</a> if you create something you’d like to share!</p>

<title>SearchLink Fixes</title>

<div> 2.3.50, DuckDuckGo, fixes, tests, SearchLink v2.3.50

修复了DuckDuckGo响应中的一些问题，目前通过了所有测试，除了一个。该版本能够将网页搜索转换为Markdown链接。源代码托管在GitHub上，可以将其编译为命令行使用的gem。每个搜索都是SearchLink，并且可以很容易地添加新的搜索类型。如果您对SearchLink进行了扩展，请务必提交Pull Request，并参与开发。可以在链接中下载该版本，并查看详细信息。总结: 2.3.50版本修复了DuckDuckGo响应中的问题。该版本通过了大多数测试，但仍有一个测试未通过。SearchLink可以将网页搜索转换为Markdown链接，并提供了扩展功能。源代码托管在GitHub上，可以将其编译为命令行使用的gem。项目欢迎开发者提交Pull Request参与开发。 <div>
<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a> 2.3.50 is out and contains fixes for some recent changes in DuckDuckGo’s responses. It currently passes all tests except for one (TMDB is returning a movie for the search result “Brad Pitt”, rather than the actor page, and when I add “actor” to the search it dumps out to IMDB, which I don’t fully understand).</p>

<p>Don’t forget that the source code is all neatly organized on GitHub and you can compile the whole thing as a gem for command line usage, if you like. Every search is <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/tree/main/lib/searchlink/searches">a plugin</a> and you can add new search types pretty easily. If you <em>do</em> extend SearchLink at all, be sure to make a Pull Request and be part of the development!</p>

<div> SaneBox, email management, Eisenhower Matrix, organized, efficient 
<br /><br />
总结: 
SaneBox是一个高级的电子邮件管理工具，通过与Eisenhower Matrix（艾森豪威尔矩阵）的结合，能够帮助用户实现电子邮件的高效整理和组织。通过创建自定义文件夹并将电子邮件分类到不同的象限，SaneBox可以根据用户的喜好和优先级来自动过滤和整理邮件。这种方法使用户能够将电子邮件管理变得有条不紊，从而获得一个独特的个性化电子邮件体验。如果你被一大堆电子邮件淹没，感到压力大，不妨尝试一下SaneBox和Eisenhower Matrix的组合。对于那些希望有一个高效有序的电子邮箱系统的人来说，这是一个值得尝试的选择。 <div>
<p>Thanks to Sanebox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I don’t know what I’d do without it!</p>

<p>Envision your email as a bustling conference hall, filled with diverse attendees. Professional correspondences, casual updates, informative newsletters, enticing promotions, and the occasional unwelcome intruder all vying for your attention. Now, consider a seasoned curator (inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix) coordinating the event, teamed up with an expert organizer (the prowess of SaneBox) to streamline the flow and ensure a harmonious gathering. This is the synergy we’re spotlighting.</p>

<p>SaneBox, our sophisticated digital tool, acquires proficiency much like a dedicated student mastering a new subject. Each interaction with your emails refines its algorithm, enhancing its efficiency. When combined with the strategic principles of the Eisenhower Matrix, which prioritizes tasks based on urgency and significance, you’re presented with a seamlessly integrated email management system.</p>

<p>Let’s get practical. The Custom Folders inside of SaneBox let you decide what’s important to you and where it belongs on the Eisenhower Matrix. Start by creating folders for each quadrant. The traditional Eisenhower Matrix works like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Urgent and Important (Quadrant I): These are tasks that need immediate attention and are crucial to your goals.</li>
  <li>Not Urgent but Important (Quadrant II): These are tasks that contribute to your long-term goals and values but don’t require immediate attention.</li>
  <li>Urgent but Not Important (Quadrant III): These tasks demand your immediate attention but aren’t critical to reaching your long-term goals.</li>
  <li>Neither Urgent nor Important (Quadrant IV): These are the tasks that provide little to no value and can often be deferred or even deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve created your folders (and named them whatever you want), start moving emails into their appropriate places. It won’t take long for SaneBox to learn what’s important to you. Then you can be selective about which folders get attention and when.</p>

<p>But it’s more than just cleaning up. This method helps shape an email experience that feels uniquely yours. Merging the practical approach of the Eisenhower Matrix with SaneBox’s functions, your inbox goes from being chaotic to organized and manageable.</p>

<p>If you’re among those buried under a mountain of emails, feeling the strain, it’s worth trying the combination of SaneBox and the Eisenhower Matrix. And remember, <a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">signing up today can even get you a $25 discount on any subscription.</a> Your emails deserve a system that works.</p>

<div> nerdy, forum, projects, interaction, community
<br /><br />总结: 作者创建了一个名为"nerdy"的论坛，目的是为了集中讨论各种项目并增加与读者的互动。作者之前的项目讨论都分散在不同的地方，现在希望通过这个统一的论坛来解决这个问题。作者选择论坛的原因是因为它是异步的，可以按照自己的时间参与讨论，并通过邮件通知了解回复。论坛的网址是forum.brettterpstra.com，作者使用了DigitalOcean和Mailgun来提供托管和通知的服务。此外，作者还将博客评论转移到了论坛上，并邀请读者来参与讨论。最后，作者希望读者能积极参与，并将读者的社群变得更活跃。 <div>

<p>I’ve created a forum for discussing all things nerdy, the <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">BrettTerpstra.com Forum</a>. I wanted a place to have conversations about my various projects, but also to allow more interaction with my readers. I’ll be active on it, and I hope you will too.</p>

<p>Right now every one of my projects has different discussion forums, mostly hosted on GitHub, but they’re separated by project and there’s no unified place for support, questions, feature requests, and actual interaction. This is my attempt to consolidate and also increase interaction with the community.</p>

<p>I’m nervous about launching this because I fear nobody will talk and I’ll feel unpopular, but I won’t know until I try. I know, one more place to be active online, one more source of notifications, yet another place to chat. I know we all have too many of these. I chose this format over a Discord server or other synchronous communication because I like that it’s _a_synchronous. You can show up when you feel like it, and just get email notifications about responses to your conversations, waiting until you have the time to add to the discussion.</p>

<p>The forum is at forum.brettterpstra.com. Here’s a <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com/invites/o9MfRxFeMG">special invite link</a> that will get you in and give you immediate access to introduce yourself and join/start a conversation.</p>

<p>I set this up using the <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/discourse/">Discord droplet</a> on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, which is a very affordable way to host cloud applications, if you’re ever interested in building your own. I’m also using a free account at <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a> to handle notification emails and such.</p>

<p>I’ve switched the comments on this blog over to using the forum as an embed. Each blog post will create a new topic on the forum, and you’ll be able to discuss and add comments via Discourse. It will require login (you can log in with GitHub or email), but should offer a saner way to handle comments on my posts. Give it a shot on this one and let me know what you think! In the process I’ve lost all comment history, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you’ll join, participate, and make a community out of my readership. Don’t be shy. I have 20,000 site viewers, 35,000 RSS subscribers, 13,000 Twitter followers, 2500 Mastodon followers, 9000 GitHub stars, and yet I still have a hard time getting interaction… I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<div> grabicon.rb, iTunes, app icon, automating giveaways, ImageMagick

抓取 iTunes 中的应用图标需要使用 grabicon.rb 脚本，该脚本可以自动化抓取应用程序的图标并进行处理。脚本支持定义平台（mac、iOS、iPad、iPhone）和图标大小（小、中、大或特定像素尺寸），如果本地应用程序找不到图标，则会在 iTunes 中搜索并返回第一个结果。对于 Mac 平台，可以从 Assets 文件中提取图标以获取更高分辨率的图标。对于 iOS 平台，脚本会自动进行圆角处理和调整图像大小。脚本还提供了多种选项和参数来定制图标的抓取和保存。该脚本作为自动化抓取应用图标的一部分，并且非常实用。

总结：<br /><br />grabicon.rb 是一个用于从 iTunes 抓取应用图标的脚本工具。这个工具可以根据定义的平台和大小抓取图标。支持的平台有 Mac、iOS、iPad、iPhone，支持的大小有 small、medium、large 或者特定的像素尺寸。在搜索本地应用图标时，如果找不到匹配的图标，则会转而搜索 iTunes 并返回第一个结果。对于 Mac 平台，可以从 Assets 文件中提取图标以获得更高的分辨率。对于 iOS 平台，脚本会自动进行圆角处理和图像调整。脚本提供多种选项来定制图标的抓取和保存。该脚本已经通过 ImageMagick 进行了测试，可以正常工作并提供了很大的实用性。 <div>
<p>A long time ago I published a tool called <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/itunesicon/">iTunesIcon</a> that would grab an app icon from iTunes. It worked well in its time, but has been mostly broken in recent years. It was designed mostly for writers who were reviewing apps and needed to get an app’s icon for artwork, but could be used by anyone with a need for such things.</p>

<p>As part of automating the giveaways I’m running, I’ve had a need to start grabbing app icons again, so I’ve revived the project. This script requires installing ImageMagick for rounding the corners of iOS icons (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install imagemagick</code>).</p>

<p>I previously had a shell function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geticonpng</code> that read a local app’s icon file. These days, most local Mac apps tend to store their icons in Assets.car archives, so the default .icns file only has images up to 256 pixels in most cases. I’ve worked around that. And when a local icon can’t be found, I’m falling back to searching iTunes, replicating the behavior of iTunesIcon. This script handles the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow defining platform (mac, iOS, iPad, iPhone)</li>
  <li>Allow defining size (small, medium, large, or specific pixel dimensions)</li>
  <li>If the platform is Mac, test for a local copy from which to extract the icon</li>
  <li>If the platform is iOS or a local Mac app isn’t found, search iTunes and return the first result</li>
  <li>If the platform is Mac and a local version is found, extract the icon from the Assets file to allow higher resolutions</li>
  <li>If the platform is iOS, automatically round the corners and resize the image</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/1f30e9042a4cfbdc68bc3fb3fec64046">Here’s the (Ruby) script</a>. It handles all of the above.</p>

<p>Platform can be defined in two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d DEVICE</code> flag when running the script. This can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ios</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iphone</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipad</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mac</code></li>
  <li>Add a modifier to the search terms in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ios</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@iphone</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ipad</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@mac</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OmniFocus @ipad</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, size can be defined using:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s SIZE</code> flag, which can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s(mall)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m(edium)</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l(arge)</code> or a specific pixel dimension (square), e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grabicon.rb -s small OmniFocus</code></li>
  <li>Use a modifier in the search terms in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s(mall)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%m(edium)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%l(arge)</code> or a specific pixel dimension, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OmniFocus %1024</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Modifiers in the search terms override flags given to the script.</p>

<p>If a local copy can be found, the asset will be extracted at any size specified. If searching iTunes, you’re generally limited to 1024px, depending on the assets the app has provided. The nearest icon format will be downloaded, and ImageMagick will convert to specific pixel dimensions. Note that when downloading an iOS icon, the artwork provided is square, so the script will round the corners and add 10% padding around the icon (using ImageMagick) to offer similar dimensions to what Mac icons have or what you see on your iOS device screen.</p>

<p>All options:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Usage: grabicon.rb 'APP NAME/SEARCH TERM' [@PLATFORM] [%SIZE]
       @ and % modifiers override options

OPTIONS:
    -p, --preview                    Show a Quick Look preview after saving
    -s, --size SIZE                  Size to save (small, medium, large, or pixels)
    -d, --device PLATFORM            Platform to search (mac, ios, iphone, ipad)
    -o, --output PATH                Path to save icon to (default ~/Desktop/ICON.png)
    -h, --help                       Display this screen</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is working well for me so far. I’ll publish the rest of the giveaway automation in the future, as it uses some ImageMagick commands I think might be useful to other people. But for now, this is <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/1f30e9042a4cfbdc68bc3fb3fec64046">the new iTunesIcon script</a>.</p>

<p>To install the script, save the raw version to a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grabicon.rb</code> in your PATH, and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x PATH/TO/grabicon.rb</code>. Once that’s done, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grabicon.rb -h</code> to see available options.</p>

<p>You may have noticed I’m running a series of giveaways on this blog. Literally every developer I’ve reached out to has been willing to put up 1-10 licenses or 1-year subscriptions for their app, and I’m <em>extremely</em> pleased with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">the list I’ve put together</a>. In an effort to keep track of all of them, I’ve built some (if I do say so myself) impressive automation around this project, and I thought I’d share. It’s some mad science, but it’s working great and I kinda want to brag about it.</p>

<p>For every giveaway, there are 5 major pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The announcement post containing the form to enter for the drawing, on Monday</li>
  <li>An announcement email to subscribers linking to the announcement post, also on Monday</li>
  <li>A followup email on Thursday reminding subscribers there’s still time to enter</li>
  <li>A drawing of the winners, and notification emails sent to them, on Friday</li>
  <li>An announcement post listing the winner’s names and upcoming giveaways, also on Friday</li>
</ol>

<p>So here’s how it works. I have a master YAML file where each giveaway has the following info:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">app_name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Timing</span>
  <span class="na">contact</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">Hookmark link to email conversation with developer</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">dev_email</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Daniel Gräfe &lt;REDACTED&gt;</span>
  <span class="na">keywords</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">productivity</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">time tracking</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">timing</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">dev_link</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://timingapp.com/</span>
  <span class="na">offer</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">a 1-year subscription ($108 value)</span>
  <span class="na">number_of_prizes</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>
  <span class="na">followup</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">I guarantee it will be useful for anyone who needs to know where they spend there time, for any reason.</span>
  <span class="na">fulfillment</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">emails</span>
  <span class="na">giveaway_slug</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">secret giveaway slug</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">blurb</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">&gt;</span>
    <span class="s">I use Timing daily and it's helped me automatically track time that I would never have had the discipline to</span>
    <span class="s">manage on my own. Billable hours, time I spend on personal projects, time I spend gaming, pretty much</span>
    <span class="s">anything I do on my Mac, my iPhone, or my iPad gets tracked and I can easily categorize based on rules</span>
    <span class="s">(that are as easy as dragging and dropping to generate). I even integrated it with</span>
    <span class="s">[Doing](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/) for adding depth to my "What Was I Doing" tracking.</span>
  <span class="na">dev_blurb</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">&gt;</span>
    <span class="s">Just keep focusing on your work while Timing records your time automatically, then review your time when you</span>
    <span class="s">want to. Record time faster than ever with just a few clicks. See when you worked on what and how</span>
    <span class="s">productive you were.</span>
  <span class="na">screenshot</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/uploads/2023/09/timingscreenshot.jpg</span>
  <span class="na">setapp</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It takes me about 10 minutes to build an entry. I have to write out my personal blurb, get a developer blurb from the website, and generate images including a screenshot (usually pulled from the website and automatically sized and converted by a <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a> script when I save it to my desktop) and a blog header and winner post header<sup id="fnref:imageautomation"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:imageautomation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. (Social sharing images and WEBP versions are automatically generated from the header images using <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch, from Flying Meat">RetroBatch</a>.) So that’s the bulk of the creation time.</p>

<p>Slotting a new giveaway in is simply a matter of adding a new entry like above to the YAML array, and I can slot them in at any point and all of the dates will adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>When my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giveaways.rb</code> script runs, it goes through this YAML file and generates all of the pieces mentioned above. It has a start date hardcoded for the start of this series, and then for each giveaway entry it adds 7 days, and sets a drawing date for the following Friday. It uses ERB templates to generate the giveaway announcement (including blurbs and screenshot), the two emails, and the winner announcement (including the followup text). The winner announcement, which gets saved to my drafts folder, includes a note letting me know exactly what command to run to execute the drawing, including how many winners to draw, where to pull the fulfillment codes from, etc. The winner announcement is also “hooked” to the conversation with the developer using <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/">Hookmark</a>, so I can easily jump back to it. It also creates a list of upcoming giveaways, saved twice, once to a Markdown file with the secret slugs used to populate and query the Firebase database for the drawing, and once to a list that becomes <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">publicly viewable</a>.</p>

<p>The fulfillment key can be one of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emails</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coupons</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codes</code>, and depends on the developer’s preference for fulfilling the giveaway. If there are coupons or codes, those get a YAML array listing them and they’re written out to an individual YAML file that the Giveaway Robot will read. The Giveaway Robot (the script that does the random picking of entrants) reads the appropriate type of fulfillment file and sends a notification email to each of the winners containing a link, a redeem code, or notification that their email has been shared with the developer (who gets cc’d based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev_email</code> setting) who will be in touch with a license.</p>

<p>The emails that are generated are in Markdown format, saved locally. On the week that a giveaway is going to run, I run a script called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_giveaway_emails.rb APP_NAME</code>, where app name is just something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">App Tamer</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Timing</code>. That will find and render the generated Markdown files, apply my BrettTerpstra.com styling, and use the <a href="https://sendy.co/" title="Sendy-Send Newsletters 100x cheaper via Amazon SES">Sendy</a> API to create and schedule both emails for the week.</p>

<p>All of these moving pieces of this are a lot to track, so the script includes notes at every pertinent point letting me know which script needs to be run, and also generates a calendar entry with an alert that links (Hookmark) to the necessary notes, which literally tell me exactly which command to run and what to do with the output.</p>

<p>There’s a Jekyll plugin that generates and runs the giveaway form. I just include:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{% giveaway SLUG ISO_END_DATE %}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is generated automatically by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giveaways.rb</code> script in the announcement post, and all entries will go to a Firebase database named for the SLUG. At the end of the giveaway, I just give the same slug to the “robot” and it uses random number generation to pick winners. The robot (run by the command in the winner announcement post note) generates emails to the winners, saves a list of names and emails, and outputs a list of winner names to the Terminal, ready for pasting into the winner announcement post. Actually it also uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pbcopy</code> to put the list right into my clipboard and opens the winner post for pasting…</p>

<p>So, aside from the time it took to build all of this automation, my effort per giveaway is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email discussion with the developer, nailing down number of copies and fulfillment options, 10m elapsed time per giveaway</li>
  <li>edit the master YAML file with details, 10m</li>
  <li>run the giveaways.rb script, 5s</li>
  <li>on Sunday
    <ul>
      <li>edit and publish the generated giveaway post for the week, 2m</li>
      <li>run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_giveaway_emails.rb</code> script to generate the emails, 5s</li>
      <li>double check the emails and scheduling because I don’t fully trust the automation, 2m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>on Wednesday
    <ul>
      <li>share the giveaway reminder to social media, 5m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>on Friday
    <ul>
      <li>run the giveaway robot using the command already saved in the winners post, 1m</li>
      <li>edit the giveaway post with the list of winners returned by the robot, 2m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, now that the automation is built, it takes me approximately 23 minutes to add and run a giveaway. This would take me at least 3 hours per week if I were doing this manually every time, with the multiple posts, the multiple emails, and the drawing/notification, plus all of the tracking down of previous conversations and handling of codes for every giveaway. So this automation is <em>easily</em> saving me almost 3 hours per giveaway, and with nearly 40 giveaways currently lined up (and growing), that’s almost 120 hours of time saved already. Easily worth the ~8 hours I put into building it.</p>

<p>I doubt all of the scripts behind this will be of use to anyone else as is, but if you want to create any kind of similar automation, I’m available to help. If you just want to see my code to alter on your own, I’ll share it for free, and if you want to hire me to build something out for you, I charge a reasonable hourly fee. If I ever lose my cushy corporate job, this is exactly the kind of thing I would love to freelance on, so keep me in mind for that fateful day.</p>

    <li id="fn:imageautomation">
      <p>All of these header images are the same background with an app icon rotated and positioned in the hand of the “giveaway robot,” but I haven’t yet been able to automate the generation of these images. I just need to extract a PNG from the app (easy), then size, rotate, and position it over a static background. RetroBatch can’t do it, so if anyone has any grand ideas, I’d love to hear them. I bet ImageMagick could do this, but I get into rabbit holes when I start looking into it… <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:imageautomation">&#8617;</a></p>

<div> Marked, Bear compatibility, Sonoma, custom preprocessor, syntax handling.<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了最近发布的Marked版本修复了与Bear兼容性的问题，并提供了一个定制的预处理器来处理Bear语法。通过使用Bear样式和预处理器，用户可以在Marked中获得与Bear相同的预览样式，也可以选择自定义样式。用户可以按照文章提供的步骤来安装Bear样式和预处理器。文章还介绍了如何处理Bear特定的语法，并提供了相应的代码示例。最后，文章提到了可能将来直接在Marked中添加对Bear语法的支持的可能性。 <div>

<p>Recent releases of Marked have fixed Bear compatibility on Sonoma. As part of this, I’ve updated the Bear style for Marked, and written a little custom preprocessor to handle Bear’s (CommonMark) syntax properly. If you want a Marked preview styled to look exactly like Bear (with all of Marked’s options for export, navigation, and other features), you can use the Bear style in combination with the preprocessor, but if you just want Bear’s syntax properly interpreted, you can use the preprocessor with the style of your choosing<sup id="fnref:underline"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:underline" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To get the Bear style, go the the <a href="https://marked2app.com/styles/">Style Gallery</a> and open the <a href="https://marked2app.com/styles/preview#Bear">Bear style</a>. Click “Install” to add it to Marked in one click.</p>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>For the custom preprocessor to work, you’ll need Ruby available on your system. As far as I know, Ruby is still distributed with macOS (for now), and if you open Terminal and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which ruby</code>, you should get a path back, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/ruby</code>. If this isn’t the case for you and you need further help, please post on <a href="http://support.markedapp.com">the support forum</a> and I’ll update the instructions as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For handling Bear’s specific syntax, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[links]]</code>, underlining, and strikethrough, you’ll need a custom preprocessor. Save the following to a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bear-preprocessor.rb</code> in a safe folder (one you won’t move in the future).</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>
<span class="c1"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>

<span class="n">input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gsub!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/~~(.*?)~~/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'&lt;del&gt;\1&lt;/del&gt;'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">input</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open terminal and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x /path/to/file/bear-preprocessor.rb</code>. That will make it executable, then you can just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/path/to/file/bear-preprocessor.rb</code> as your custom preprocessor path in Marked-&gt;Advanced preferences. (To get the absolute path for a file, right click it in Finder, hold down Option, and click ‘Copy “bear-preprocess.rb” as Pathname’. That will put the absolute path to the file in your clipboard, which you can paste for both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> command and the Custom Preprocessor field.)</p>

<p>This script will convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[wiki links]]</code> into Bear internal links, which will open linked notes in Bear when clicked, and handle special cases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~strikethrough~~</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~underline~</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">, and </code>==highlighting==`.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll want to set your Processor to MultiMarkdown and enable “#Text is tag” and the sub-item “Style tags” in Preferences-&gt;Processor. Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#tag</code> processing will only work if you’re not using a custom <em>processor</em> (custom <em>pre</em>processor like above won’t override it).</p>

<p>If you need additional help setting this up, just ping me on <a href="http://support.markedapp.com">http://support.markedapp.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using a non-Bear Style and want underlines formatted, you can modify a custom Style or add the following to Marked-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Style-&gt;Additional CSS and modify as desired:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="nc">.underline</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">border-bottom</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1px</span> <span class="nb">solid</span> <span class="nb">rgb</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">222</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">84</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">86</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="err">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I might eventually add support for Bear (CommonMark) syntax directly to Marked, but the whole purpose of the preprocessor functionality was to handle cases like this, and linking to Bear documents internally should be a case-by-case decision. The same part of the custom preprocessor that handles <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[links]]</code> could be repurposed for any system that allows internal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[linking]]</code> and has a url handler syntax (like nvUltra, which I’ll post a preprocessor for when it’s available<sup id="fnref:right"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:right" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, or Obsidian). You can also always set up CommonMark as a custom processor to get full compatibility.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:underline">
      <p>It won’t include underline styling unless you add it to your Style, as detailed below <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:underline">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:right">
      <p>you don’t believe me at this point, which is fully understandable, but it really is coming. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:right">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>

<title>Marked and Bunch updates for Sonoma</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16381661/marked-and-bunch-updates-for-sonoma</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16381661/marked-and-bunch-updates-for-sonoma</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Marked, Bunch Beta, fixes, Sonoma, updates
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章简要介绍了Marked和Bunch Beta的更新情况，这些更新主要解决了Sonoma上的问题，并修复了一些功能失效的情况。文章提到，Marked更新已经在直接购买渠道上线，并在Setapp和Mac App Store上进行审核中，而Bunch Beta版本的更新则主要修复了Sonoma上的问题，并且需要用户的反馈确认功能是否正常。 <div>
<p>Just a quick note to let you know that there are new versions of Marked and Bunch Beta with some fixes for Sonoma.</p>

<p>The Marked update is live for direct customers, and in review for Setapp and Mac App Store customers. Watch for updates on your channel. It fixes an issue that prevented Marked from opening <em>any</em> files on Sonoma, and also crashes when using with Drafts’ or Bear’s “Preview in Marked” features. It should solve the issue for all versions of macOS.</p>

<p>The Bunch update is specifically to fix modifier keys not working when clicking Bunches in the menu. E.g. you’re supposed to be able to Cmd-Click a Bunch and open the text file in your editor of choice instead of launching it, and this wasn’t working anymore. The current release of the Beta should solve it. I would love some feedback on whether it’s working for you on Sonoma, and additionally whether I broke it for people on earlier versions of macOS.

<div> giveaway, 1-year subscription, Timing, time tracking, productivity
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章介绍了一项抽奖活动，奖品是一年期的订阅费用为108美元的Timing软件。该软件可以自动追踪时间，帮助用户记录工作时间、个人项目时间、游戏时间等，并且可以根据规则进行分类。文章还介绍了Timing的功能和优势，鼓励读者参与抽奖活动。 <div>

<p>I’m excited to offer the next giveaway, a 1-year subscription ($108 value) for <a href="https://timingapp.com/">Timing</a>. I use Timing daily and it’s helped me automatically track time that I would never have had the discipline to manage on my own. Billable hours, time I spend on personal projects, time I spend gaming, pretty much anything I do on my Mac, my iPhone, or my iPad gets tracked and I can easily categorize based on rules (that are as easy as dragging and dropping to generate). I even integrated it with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/">Doing</a> for adding depth to my “What Was I Doing” tracking.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just keep focusing on your work while Timing records your time automatically, then review your time when you want to. Record time faster than ever with just a few clicks. See when you worked on what and how productive you were.</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Historical weather for Journal CLI</title>

<div> 更新、命令行日志工具、历史天气数据、月相、数据收集、心情信息、翻译等<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了命令行日志工具的更新内容，包括可以添加过去日期的自然语言参数，获取历史天气数据，以及跟踪月相等功能。作者对工具的使用感到满意，并愿意帮助他人提供更多帮助。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">

<p>I pushed a couple updates to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a>, my command line journaling tool today.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you can add a natural language argument to your journal command which will set the date of the entry, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journal mood "yesterday 8pm"</code>. This allows you to create entries in post with historical data you might have missed. One thing that it didn’t do well, though, is to get the <em>correct</em> weather for any weather type questions in the journal when using past dates. This latest update is able to get historical weather data and insert it correctly in the entry. No changes required for the user, just enter a past date and Journal will figure it out.</p>

<p>Second, I’ve noticed my mood and sleep shifts with the moon phase. I’m not into astrology or anything, but that seemed like useful data to track and start to draw better conclusions from. So now a question type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.forecast</code> will include the moon phase as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moon_phase</code> key, and you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.moon</code> to get just the moon phase for its own entry. The forecast in Markdown will also now include the moon phase.</p>

<p>That’s it, just tying up some loose ends. Journal is working pretty well for me to collect data and provide my therapist with detailed mood/behavior information. Let me know if there’s anything it doesn’t do that might help you out!</p>

<p>The latest version can be installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. Visit the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> project page for more info.</p>

<div> SaneBox, email clutter, custom folders, personalized email experience, adaptive technology<br /><br />总结: SaneBox是一个强大的电子邮件管理工具，通过其自定义文件夹功能，用户可以根据自己的喜好和优先级来将邮件分类整理，从而创造一个个性化的电子邮件体验。这个功能的灵活性使用户能够根据工作习惯和优先级自由自在地组织邮件，提高工作效率。SaneBox的自适应技术将用户置于核心位置，为用户提供更高效、个性化的邮件管理服务。如果您还在为杂乱的收件箱而烦恼，不妨尝试一下SaneBox的自定义文件夹功能吧。 <div>
<p>Thanks to Sanebox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I just trained 3 new senders into custom Sanebox folders today (just by moving an email from them once) and will never have to see them in my Inbox again, and will be able to easily locate them when I <em>do</em> want to see them. It’s so easy!</p>

<p>SaneBox is once again under the spotlight for their cutting-edge solutions to the age-old problem of email clutter. Having earned the endorsement of seasoned professionals, it’s worth diving deeper into another feature that makes SaneBox the power tool for email management. One feature that is particularly enchanting? Custom Folders.</p>

<p>Imagine this: You receive countless emails daily from various sources. Newsletters from your favorite brands, updates from work, personal emails, bulk offers, and then, those pesky spam mails. Now, think of an assistant who not only sorts your emails but also does it exactly how you would. That means keeping in mind your unique preferences and priorities. That’s what SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature offers.</p>

<p>At the core of SaneBox is its learning ability. For example, as you shuffle emails in and out of folders like @SaneLater or @SaneBlackHole, SaneBox observes. Over time, it finds patterns in your preferences and ensures similar emails find their rightful place automatically in the future. It’s like training your dog to fetch. Once it learns which toy is its favorite, it fetches it every single time.</p>

<p>One particularly intriguing aspect of this feature is the flexibility it offers. Let’s say you’re working on a project, and you want all communications about it to be in one place. Simply create a Custom Folder named “@ProjectX.” As you get emails related to the project, drag a few to the new folder, and then SaneBox will quickly learn to play fetch.</p>

<p>The beauty of SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature lies in its adaptability. It’s not just about categorizing. It’s about creating an email ecosystem that aligns with your work habits and priorities. The more seamless a process is, the more likely you’ll be to use it. So that adaptability is critical.</p>

<div> journal-cli, 更新, 特性, 条件, bug fixes.<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了 journal-cli 的更新内容，包括新特性和 bug 修复。用户现在可以根据指定的条件来确定是否提问，并且可以添加不同类型的天气数据。还提到了一些 bug 修复和一些使用上的注意事项。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="Journal Screenshot" class="aligncenter" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/09/journal-header-rb.jpg" title="Journal Screenshot" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>In case you missed it, I recently released <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal CLI">Journal</a>, a CLI for keeping a journal with structured data that can be queried and analyzed. An update is live with a couple of nifty new features.</p>

<p>First, instead of just a type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather</code> for a question (which inserts the current condition and daily forecast), you can now specify sub-types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.current</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.forecast</code>. This outputs separate data entries to the JSON, and creates individual answers in the Markdown/Day One versions. You can still just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather</code> as the type to insert all data.</p>

<p>Second, you can now apply conditions to questions to determine whether they’ll be asked or not when creating an entry. Right now only time-based conditions are implemented, but I plan to add some functionality around basing a question’s appearance on the answer to a previous question, like “if health rating is less than 5, display the health notes question.” But for now you can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition: before noon</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition: &gt; 2pm</code> to any question or section to only display the question(s) at certain times of day.</p>

<p>I needed these conditions because I like to create a mood entry in the morning with data about sleep and coffee, and in the evening I don’t want to repeat that data, but do want to ask some different questions about how the day went. I could create two separate journals for these, but this way I can compile all of my data in one file. Questions that are skipped get a null entry in the JSON, so when I’m parsing I just test for nil and skip entries that don’t contain the information I’m trying to output. Unanswered questions don’t get added to the Markdown/Day One entries at all.</p>

<p>This release includes a couple of bug fixes as well. I recently removed the requirement for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gum</code> CLI, if it doesn’t exist it will now just use Readline for input. When using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gum</code> inputs, you can’t CTRL-c to cancel an entry, which I’m trying to figure out a way around right now.</p>

<p>Update using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. Visit the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal CLI">project page</a> for more info and installation instructions.</p>

<div> Jekyll plugin, countdown, 40% off sale, coupon, September 16th,
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一个Jekyll插件，可以用来实现倒计时功能。作者通过插件创建了一个倒计时，用于促销活动。文章中提到了一个40%折扣销售，截止日期是9月16日，使用特定的优惠码可以享受折扣优惠。 <div>
<p>So, a long time ago I wrote this Jekyll plugin that does countdowns and I don’t think I ever really used it. You just give it an end date and it inserts a countdown into the post. But I needed something to count down to, so I’m running a 40% off <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> sale using the coupon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COOLPLUGINBRO</code> until Saturday, September 16th. Here’s your countdown:</p>

<div class="btcountdownwrapper">
            <p class="btcountdowncaption">Sale ends in...</p>
            <div class="btcountdown"><time datetime="2023-09-16T23:59:00-05:00"></time></div>
            </div>

<p>Did it work? I hope so. Use <a href="http://pay.paddle.com/checkout/489454?coupon=COOLPLUGINBRO">this link to apply the coupon directly</a>, or enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COOLPLUGINBRO</code> at checkout. Learn more about Marked at <a href="https://marked2app.com">marked2app.com</a>.</p>

<title>Journal and integrations</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16342944/journal-and-integrations</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16342944/journal-and-integrations</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 日期类型、字典类型、集成应用、JSON格式、功能扩展 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了对Journal软件的功能改进，包括日期类型和字典类型的定义，以及与Obsidian等应用的集成。通过引入YAML数据，可以更好地控制结构化数据，便于构建分析工具。此外，文章还提到了版本更新和软件安装方法。 <div>
<p>I’ve made some changes to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> (I didn’t mess with the data format this time) that add some functionality and will maybe help with integrating with some apps like Obisidian.</p>

<p>First, you can now define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> type. Date entries will be parsed from natural language into date objects, so on the command line you can enter something like “yesterday 5pm” or “july 20 12pm” and get a proper date object added to your JSON and Markdown entries. Great for things like logging book review dates, workout days, etc.</p>

<p>You can also now define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dictionary</code> type for a question, which along with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key</code> definition creates a nested data set with any dot notation keys that match. So you can define the following:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">mood</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">sections</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Status"</span>
    <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">status</span>
    <span class="na">questions</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health</span>
        <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">dictionary</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health.rating</span>
        <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">numeric</span>
        <span class="na">prompt</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Health Rating</span>
        <span class="na">min</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>
        <span class="na">max</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">10</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health.notes</span>
  <span class="na">    type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">multiline</span>
        <span class="s">prompt</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s">Health Notes</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The data that gets output will include this format in the JSON:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"mood"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"rating"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"notes"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Just some notes on my health"</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows for more control over the structured data. It won’t be a big deal for most people as answers were already nested within section keys and could be grouped using dot syntax, this just allows the structure to go one level deeper which may help with building analytics tools.</p>

<p>The big change that will allow more integrations with apps like Obsidian is that all numeric and date answers are now included as YAML front matter in any individual Markdown files created. This will allow integration with existing tools like <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">Obsidian Dataview</a>, which allows you to create data views based on YAML data in your Obsidian notes. By pointing Journal to your Vault folder, you can have journal entries added to your vault and queryable with Dataview. I haven’t tested this, I just noted that it should be possible with the addition of the YAML data. For the time being I’m not including any string responses in the YAML, as that seems redundant since they’re also included in the body text and available to search.</p>

<p>This update won’t affect data saved to single Markdown files or added to Day One. If you have any ideas about how this could be made more useful, please let me know! Either via the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/journal-cli/discussions">Discussions</a> or by <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">contacting me directly</a>.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.19 is out now, just install or upgrade with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">project page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>More na updates</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16340947/more-na-updates</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16340947/more-na-updates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Command line tool, na, theming, new commands, changelog, TaskPaper files.
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了命令行工具na的最新版本更新，包括了主题设置、新的命令和修复的问题等内容。na是一个用于读取和修改TaskPaper文件的工具。更新后的na版本增加了主题设置功能，使得用户可以自定义操作的颜色输出。此外，还添加了一些新的命令和改进，以及修复了一些问题。详细的更新内容可以在文章的changelog中查看。 <div>
<p>I’ve put some more time into both <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code>. The latest version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> represents quite a few hours of tinkering. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">na project page</a> for full details. In case you’ve missed in previously, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> is my command line tool for reading and modifying TaskPaper files in your projects.</p>

<p>I think the biggest thing I’ve added is theming. You can now control the colorized output of your actions using a file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/na/theme.yaml</code>. That file is automatically written by na if it runs and it doesn’t exist, and once it’s there, it should be pretty self explanatory. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{y}</code> type placeholders (that would make the following text yellow, a full list of color abbreviations is at the top of the file), and you can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#RGB}</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#RRGGBB}</code> codes to get specific colors outside of the usual ANSI coloring.</p>

<p>I’ve added new commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag</code> (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na help tag</code>), and a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--restore</code> option to several commands for removing the @done tag from actions. There’s also a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--replace</code> flag you can tie into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --search SEARCH_STRING --replace REPLACE_STRING</code> to perform (wildcard-compatible) search and replace. Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--regex</code> to do a regex search and replace.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of other new stuff, so I’ll just post the collected changelog.</p>

<h4 id="new">NEW</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Global option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--include_ext</code> can be configured to use full extension when displaying filenames, allowing for command-clicking to open in compatible terminals</li>
  <li>Tag command</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--save NAME</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code> to save more complex queries and run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved NAME</code> (or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na NAME</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved --select</code> flag to allow interactive selection of search(es)</li>
  <li>Open the todos database in an editor with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na todos --edit</code></li>
  <li>A theme file is written to ~/.local/share/na/theme.yaml where you can modify the colors used for all displays</li>
  <li>Allow TAG=~PATTERN comparison for regex matching in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na tagged</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na undo</code> command to undo last change or last change to file specified in arguments</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --search OLD_TEXT --replace NEW_TEXT</code> (added –replace)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="improved">IMPROVED</h4>

<ul>
  <li>When displaying actions wider than the screen, wrap at words and indent 2 spaces from start of action (after prefix)</li>
  <li>When not showing notes, add an asterisk at the end of an action</li>
  <li>When showing notes, indent to the beginning of the action</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--project</code> to archive, complete, and update to move a modified action to a new project when saving</li>
  <li>Allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved --delete</code> to handle multiple arguments</li>
  <li>Allow wildcards when deleting saved searches</li>
  <li>Refactor request for input, no change to user experience</li>
  <li>Refined wildcard (?*) handling</li>
  <li>Better error message for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code> when no todo is matched</li>
  <li>If STDOUT isn’t a TTY, don’t enable pagination, regardless of global setting</li>
  <li>Disable pagination when using –omnifocus</li>
  <li>Allow –find or –grep as synonyms for –search</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--in TODO</code> option for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na complete</code></li>
  <li>If a search string contains @tags and –exact or –regex isn’t specified, the @tags will be extracted and passed as a –tagged search.</li>
  <li>Tag handling (including values and comparisons) in tags extracted from search strings</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na complete --project PROJ</code> flag to move to a specific project</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na restore --project PROJ</code> flag to move restored action to</li>
  <li>Exit gracefully if tagged command is run with invalid arguments</li>
  <li>Display action affected when using update command</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">FIXED</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Change default :dirname coloring to fix an occasional highlighting issue</li>
  <li>Error when creating new project in todo file</li>
  <li>Error when last_modified.txt hasn’t been written yet</li>

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--no-color</code> wasn’t stripping templated hex codes</li>
  <li>Escape search for tokens to allow parenthesis and other reserved characters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Time is your most precious resource.</strong> You <em>need</em> to know how you are spending it.</p>

<p><strong>But time tracking is no fun.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://timingapp.com/brett2023" rel="nofollow">Timing</a> fixes that.</strong><br />
It <em>automatically</em> tracks <em>all</em> your time, without you lifting a finger:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timing records how long you use each app, document, and website — without start/stop timers. <strong>These timmes can also be automatically categorized using rules, so you don’t have to do it manually.</strong></li>
  <li>It <strong>imports your iPhone and iPad usage</strong> from Screen Time, giving you a complete picture of all your device usage. No other time tracking app for Mac does this!</li>
  <li>In addition, Timing will also import <strong>phone calls from your iPhone</strong>, so those don’t get lost.</li>
  <li>The same goes for meetings you attend: Timing will automatically <strong>show events from your calendar</strong>, so you never forget to record time spent in meetings again.</li>
  <li>But even when a meeting isn’t on your calendar, Timing automatically <strong>recognizes when a call ends</strong> and lets you record time for it, so that no meeting goes untracked.</li>
  <li>Similarly, when you return to your Mac after a break, Timing will <strong>ask you what you did</strong> during your time away.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these features are <em>optional</em> and configurable, of course. And its <strong>brand-new vertical timeline</strong> makes it even easier to see what you did at a glance.</p>

<p>Timing is the one time-tracking app that will <em>really</em> give you <strong>a complete picture of where your time goes,</strong> all while <em>taking</em> you <strong>much less time to maintain</strong> than other time trackers.</p>

<title>Important Journal CLI updates</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16338322/important-journal-cli-updates</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16338322/important-journal-cli-updates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> dot syntax, nested keys, data format, custom folders, tool usefulness<br /><br />总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了一个工具的更新内容，修复了使用点语法嵌套键时出现的问题，并添加了自定义文件夹选项来保存条目。这些改进使得工具更加实用。 <div>
<p>Just a couple quick updates to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">Journal CLI</a> I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/09/06/journal-a-cli-for-journaling/">published yesterday</a> that I wanted everyone who was trying it out to know about before they have too much data in it.</p>

<p>First, if keys were nested using dot syntax, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">health.rating</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">health.sleep</code>, it would create a hash like:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"rating"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> 
      </span><span class="nl">"sleep"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="w"> 
   </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">  
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the “health” key got doubled and nested inside of the section key. This isn’t the way it was supposed to work with the dot syntax. Version 1.0.15 fixes this, if a key is repeated it’s merged with the parent key instead of nesting.</p>

<p>I also added options for defining custom folders to save entries in. At the top level you can include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entries_folder</code> with a path to any folder on your system. Journals will all save to that folder with subdirectories for each of their keys. You can instead define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entries_folder</code> within a journal definition, allowing each journal to have a custom location. JSON and Markdown will be written to these folders based on settings.</p>

<p>That should help make this tool a bit more useful, sorry for changing the data format, but better sooner than later. Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">project page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>Journal, a CLI for journaling</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16334303/journal-a-cli-for-journaling</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16334303/journal-a-cli-for-journaling</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> couple's therapy, neurodivergence, command-line tool, data collection, journaling<br /><br />总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了一种命令行工具，用于在夫妻治疗中收集数据并进行日记记录。这个工具可以处理数字、字符串和多行输入，并且可以创建Day One和Markdown版本的条目。它还可以记录每天的天气情况。虽然还没有实现查询数据集的功能，但作者认为通过统计分析可以对数据进行跟踪和相关性分析。通过这个工具，作者能够获得自己的情绪和日志的概览。希望这个工具能对其他人也有帮助。 <div>
<p>I recently started couple’s therapy to try and improve the often-complicated relationship between myself (ADHD, bipolar) and my partner (autistic) and all of the unique problems that combination of neurodivergence presents. As part of this, I was asked to keep a journal containing certain data points. I started off journaling in Day One, but immediately realized that I was collecting some numeric data that I wouldn’t be able to do anything with unless it was stored in a database format of some kind. So I wrote a tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/journal-cli/">Journal</a> is a command-line tool that takes a configuration of journals, sections, and questions, presents the questions on the command line, and records the answers to JSON, as well as optionally creating Day One and Markdown versions of the entries. It can handle numeric data, string and multiline input, as well as automatically recording the daily weather for each entry.</p>

<p>To use it you need <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum">Gum</a> installed (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install gum</code>). If you want to use the Day One integration, you’ll also need to <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/command-line-interface-cli/">install the Day One CLI</a>. Those are the only prerequisites. You can just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code> to get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journal</code> command set up. It can handle multiple journal configurations and multiple output formats. It takes some configuration, but it’s very flexible (and will probably get more flexible as new needs arise).</p>

<p>I haven’t written the part of this that can query the datasets created yet. That’s going to be pretty individualized based on your needs, but I think everything should be there in the JSON to allow tracking and correlations with a little statistical analysis work. I’ll dig into it more once I’ve collected enough data. In the meantime, it’s also creating nicely-formatted Day One entries so I can get an overview of my moods and journals.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/journal-cli/">project page</a> for details on setup and configuration. Hopefully others will find this useful, too!</p>

<title>A bit more na work</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16322833/a-bit-more-na-work</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16322833/a-bit-more-na-work</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I went on a trip to Minneapolis this weekend. It went really well; I saw some 
great friends, ate some great food, and spent some early mornings coding at the hotel. I was just coding to kill time when I couldn’t sleep, and playing with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code></a> seemed like the perfect way to do it.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was take a second stab at “decomposing” the main binary so that each command had its own file, just to make maintenance easier. Finally got that working properly. It won’t change anything for the user, but it’s so much nicer <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/na_gem/tree/main/bin/commands">to look at</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> commands I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/08/22/some-na-updates-and-new-commands/">added last week</a>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> command now has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--restore</code> flag that can be used to remove the @done tag from an action or actions. It’s the same as using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--remove done</code>, but I find it just a little more intuitive. This flag is mirrored as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na restore [SEARCH]</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na unfinish [SEARCH]</code>) command.</p>

<p>I also added pagination, so for output that is longer than your screen, it will now pause using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code> if available, letting you page through with shortcut keys. This also applies to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help</code> command, so it’s easier to wade through the extensive documentation that the command provides. You can disable this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na --no-pager [COMMAND]</code>, a setting which can be saved to your config.</p>

<p>I added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na completed</code> command to view @done actions. It accepts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--before</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--on</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--after</code> flags that recognize natural language dates and can be combined. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--tagged TAG</code> to find actions tagged with any combination of tags (use comma separated list or use the flag multiple times, include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> to make a tag mandatory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> to negate). Any arguments passed to the command will function as a tokenized text search. And, of course, you can run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--save [NAME]</code> to save a complex search for later use with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved</code> command.</p>

<p>Speaking of saved searches, I also changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saved</code> command to allow multiple saved searches to run at once. So now if you have a saved search for low priority and one for medium priority, you can run them both together with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved lowprio medprio</code> and get combined results.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--done</code> flag not working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code></li>
  <li>Missing descriptions in help examples</li>
  <li>When replacing a priority tag, remove any space before it the action text</li>
  <li>Detect @tags in search strings and convert them to tag search with comparisons</li>
</ul>

<title>Some na updates and new commands</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16308395/some-na-updates-and-new-commands</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16308395/some-na-updates-and-new-commands</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve updated <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">na</a> with some new stuff I thought I’d share.</p>

<p>First off, I wanted an easy way to archive all @done actions in one swoop without having to use a lot of flags and switches to locate them and move them. So I added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> command, which takes a search string as an argument, but also has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--done</code> switch that will archive all @done tasks. So you can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na archive --done</code>, select the file to affect if there are multiple available, and presto, “archive all finished” is done, just like in TaskPaper.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>NAME
    archive - Mark an action as @done and archive

SYNOPSIS

    na [global options] archive [command options] ACTION

COMMAND OPTIONS
    --all             - Act on all matches immediately (no menu)
    -d, --depth=DEPTH - Search for files X directories deep (default: 1)
    --done            - Archive all done tasks
    -e, --regex       - Interpret search pattern as regular expression
    --file=PATH       - Specify the file to search for the task (default: none)
    -n, --note        - Prompt for additional notes. Input will be appended to any existing note. If STDIN input (piped) is detected, it
                        will be used as a note.
    -o, --overwrite   - Overwrite note instead of appending
    --tagged=TAG      - Match actions containing tag. Allows value comparisons (may be used more than once, default: none)
    -x, --exact       - Match pattern exactly

EXAMPLE

    # Find "An existing task", mark @done if needed, and move to archive
    na archive "An existing task"</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> command that will add a @done tag to whatever action matches your search (menu provided for multiple results), or all matches using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--all</code> switch. It’s basically a shortcut for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --finish SEARCH_STRING</code>. It’s aliased as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finish</code> as well. Both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> commands have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--note</code> switch that allows you to add a note (prompted if there’s nothing piped to it). All of the matching options from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> command are available, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--tagged</code> for searching by tag and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--regex</code> for doing a regular expression search. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--archive</code> switch that will simultaneously add a @done tag and move the action to the Archive.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>NAME
    complete - Find and mark an action as @done

SYNOPSIS

    na [global options] complete [command options] ACTION

<title>Convert RegExRX native files to Markdown snippets</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16306720/convert-regexrx-native-files-to-markdown-snippets</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16306720/convert-regexrx-native-files-to-markdown-snippets</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I <em>love</em> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/regexrx/id498370702?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">RegExRX</a> for testing regular expressions. It has all the features I could want from such an app, including the ability to copy a working regex out prepared for a range of languages. It’s what I’ve stuck with for years.</p>

<p>As I experiment with my regexes, I’ll save them in RegExRX, creating a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> file in my Snippets folder (where <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a> works). In order to make these searchable with Snibbets, I use a script to convert the XML-based <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> file to a Markdown file with the flags, search string, and the replace string and test text if they exist. I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/regexrx2md/">turned this into a gem</a> for anyone who should happen to run into such a need.</p>

<p>You can install the tool with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install regexrx2md</code>. Once installed, just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regexrx2md -o MARKDOWN_DIRECTORY SOURCE_DIRECTORY</code> to output a bunch of Markdown files from a directory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> files. You can also convert a single file just by providing a file link as the argument instead of a directory.</p>

<p>There are options for manipulating the filename, the Markdown template, and the output directory. See <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/regexrx2md/">the docs</a> for more info. While I hope this is useful to someone, it was something I useful enough to me to invest the time in, so it’s already paid off sufficiently. I just thought I’d share… just in case.</p>

<title>Kaleidoscope 4.1: Now with Git File History (and a special coupon) [Sponsor]</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to Kaleidoscope for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! The addition of Git History diffing is excellent, and I’m excited to share it with everybody.</p>

<p><a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" rel="nofollow">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

<p>Review versions of text and image files — and even folders full of files — with the world’s most powerful file comparison app. Kaleidoscope gives you powerful tools to use at each stage of the development cycle.</p>

<p>Now with version 4.1, Kaleidoscope continues to innovate by directly integrating with Git to show you a history for a single file. This makes it incredibly easy to track changes to a file over time. <a href="https://blog.kaleidoscope.app/2023/08/08/kaleidoscope-4-1-and-git/" rel="nofollow">Check out this blog post</a> for a detailed overview of how you can use this powerful new integration.</p>

<p>As Michael Tsai wrote: “… Kaleidoscope makes some of these tasks really easy. There are many ways to get it to open a single file, and then it automatically loads the history (and even the previous version, if you want). It’s easy to navigate the history to pick which versions you want to compare.  I’ve seen many different apps implement this type of interface, and Kaleidoscope’s version may be the best.”</p>

<p>Dave Verwer: “The UI of clicking through the history of a file with A and B buttons is simple and brilliant.”</p>

<p>In case you missed it, here are some of the most exciting features we added to Kaleidoscope with version 4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax coloring, with multiple built-in themes.</li>
  <li>Transform any comparison into a merge document that can be edited inline.</li>
  <li>Text filters to clean up diffs by removing irrelevant data, such as time stamps, object addresses and unique identifiers.</li>
  <li>Kaleidoscope Prism, a new helper app in the menu bar to quickly launch comparisons even if Kaleidoscope is not running.</li>
  <li>Debugger integration for Python developers.</li>
  <li>File properties show metadata, including size, file type, dates, and encoding.</li>
  <li>A welcome window that speeds up the processes of creating new comparisons or finding recent ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subscriptions start at $8 per month for a yearly plan. Use the coupon code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code> (valid until August 31, 2023) to get 20% off for the first year. <a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" rel="nofollow">Check it out today!</a></p>

<title>Orchard Resales: get yourself a Mac mini, cheap [Sponsor]</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to Orchard Resales for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! If you’re looking for an older Mac mini to use as a server or entertainment center, you can pick up used 2012/2014 models <em>dirt</em> cheap!</p>

<p><a href="https://orchardresales.com/collections/all" rel="nofollow">

            </a></p>

<p>I use a 2012 Mac mini as a basement server, running headless (no keyboard or monitor) and controlled over screen sharing. It runs Docker (and a few containers that give me things like network speed charts and VPN tunneling), Plex, and all of my home automation with all of my controllers hooked up to its USB ports. I also have a Synology, but you can easily set up file storage and serving with a Mac mini and a big external RAID drive. The one I run in my basement is a 2012 with a 500GB SSD and 16GB RAM. I’ve never needed to upgrade it any further to get everything I need out of it.</p>

<p>Want to set up your own, or have another use in mind for an old mini? Well, thanks to Orchard Resales you can pick one up for as little as $50 US. Deck one out with 16GB of RAM and an SSD and you’ll come out around $100. For a whole server, and it’s as easy to set up as using a Mac. And if you need spare parts, you can get non-functional Mac minis starting at just $15.</p>

<p>No, these can’t run the latest macOS, but for 99% of uses, they don’t need to, and if you’re really into it, you can use <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a> to get all the functionality you need.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://orchardresales.com/collections/all" rel="nofollow">Orchard Resales</a> today and get started with your own server! Or buy a bunch and make a server farm!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m afraid you’ve been seeing a lot of sponsored posts and not enough posts from me lately, so I thought I’d try to explain why.</p>

<p>After a relationship in my life was destabilized and I had an outsized reaction to it, I started trying to figure out what was going on with me. I was pointed toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder">Complex PTSD</a> and from there I discovered that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_trauma_syndrome">Religious Trauma Syndrome</a>, while not a part of the DSM, was a recognized thing, and that the causes and symptoms fit me perfectly.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last couple of weeks trying to unpack what this means for me. So much of the me I’ve come to know is explained by this: my attention issues, my memory problems, my emotional dysregulation, my drug addictions, and even my Bipolar Disorder can all be tied to RTS and CPTSD.</p>

<p>I grew up as a “different” kid in a fundamentalist church. As a young child I had urges and thoughts that I constantly feared would send me to hell. When I wasn’t worried about my eternal soul, I was worried about my non-Christian friends and <em>their</em> eternal souls. By the time I was in Middle School I was drinking and trying to cope with what amounts to a <em>constant</em> fight or flight response, in addition to grief.</p>

<p>Being neurodivergent, queer, and highly sensitive was not a good combination for me in the church I grew up in. And I was taught to put all of my value, all credit for my successes, and all forms of attachment into God, not earthly things. So when I decided the church wasn’t good for me (or, in my mind, for anyone), I had the secondary trauma of leaving. Becoming emotionally estranged from my family, losing my Christian friends, and losing a god, the one thing that I had ever believed could save me. I still have a lot to learn about attachment theory, but it’s safe to say that I never felt securely attached to any people in my life, from my earliest memories. Which, to be fair, are very sparse, because a symptom of CPTSD is amnesia, if I understand it correctly. I’ve always wondered why everyone else remembered so many things from their younger years and I only had occasional memories of moments. Not events, not periods, nothing substantial, only snippets. I couldn’t remember who was there, how I felt about them, only whether I felt safe or scared in that moment. And most of what I remember is feeling scared.</p>

<p>I started therapy with a new counselor last week. She actually has a psychology PhD and does trauma-informed therapy, and I think she’ll be much more helpful than my last therapist. I have high hopes. All I know is that if it doesn’t work out I absolutely have to keep working to find a good fit, because this shit is more than I know how to deal with on my own, and I can’t expect the people in my life to deal with it for me. All of my insecurities have been laid bare, I’m reacting to the world from a raw and frightened place non-stop, and it’s exhausting. I need to learn how to find security, validation, and love within myself and not depend on external sources just to exist. And that’s something I never learned how to do as a Christian. It’s been 30 years since I stopped believing, and I’m still not a whole person.</p>

<p>I’m an atheist these days, and it was a hard fought battle against my ingrained thoughts. I declared myself agnostic in my late teens, but it seriously took 20 years for me to stop looking over my shoulder and wondering if I was making a serious mistake that would <em>definitely</em> doom me to eternity in Hell. I’m over that now, I think, but I still watch anti-theist YouTube all the time, and it makes me wonder if part of me is still scared. I don’t have any interest in the god of the Bible — he’s a real asshole. And I was raised to believe that any other version of God was heresy — even other sects of Christians were going to hell. If you didn’t worship the specific version of God that was defined by my church, you were going to burn. So if I can’t accept that religion, then there’s no religion that would calm my nervous system. It was trained into me as a child. I’m constitutionally incapable of having Faith (capital F), and I was taught that without Faith you’re doomed, and now I’m just trying to put it all behind me. I’m flailing a bit.</p>

<p>I had to tell my parents I couldn’t see them for Saturday morning breakfast for a while. They’ve always been kind to me. They (and their friends) have prayed for my eternal soul. They raised me the way they were raised and I don’t blame them for repeating the trauma. But every time I see them I’m re-traumatized and I didn’t realize what was happening until now. I’ve been to the hospital multiple times with heart problems, and guess what? It was almost always within 24 hours of having breakfast with my parents. I’ve decided that’s not a coincidence. They were very understanding, and I really believe they want the best for me, I just can’t disassociate them from my childhood trauma. Hopefully I can let go of that and reestablish a relationship with my parents.</p>

<p>So that’s why I haven’t been writing. I’ve been trying to grapple with 45 years of fear I had successfully avoided until now. I’ll be back. I’m reading, I’m going to therapy, I’m working to understand and develop tools for moving forward. I’m going to be stronger for having all of this laid bare and being forced to deal with it.</p>

<title>BetterTouchTool: Introducing floating menus [Sponsor]</title>

<p>Thanks to BetterTouchTool for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! I am a <em>huge</em> fan of BetterTouchTool and use it all day every day on my Mac. I wouldn’t know what to do without it. From customizing my keyboard shortcuts to adding infinite gestures to my trackpad to running my entire Stream Deck setup, there’s nothing this little utility can’t do.</p>

            </a></p>

<p>I think BetterTouchTool is well known to readers of this blog (thanks Brett!), so I won’t go into the details of the many things you can do with it. Instead I want to promote a powerful new feature that has been added to BTT recently and is currently in beta phase: Floating Menus.</p>

<p>Imagine them as highly flexible, widget-like menus that you can place virtually anywhere on your screen.  You can attach them to specific positions in specific windows, to specific screens, the current mouse position and many more. You can specify whether they float on top, stick them to your desktop or have them behave like normal windows (and more). </p>

<p>They can always be visible, expand on mouse hover or be shown/hidden via any trigger in BTT.</p>

<p>A Floating Menu contains either standard buttons, or widgets like sliders or even web view items. Their appearance is completely customizable. All items are fully scriptable via AppleScript or Javascript, and soon there will be a plugin system to load custom widgets.</p>

<p>The Floating Menus will soon become the basis for numerous existing BetterTouchTool features, such as Stream Deck and Notch Bar support and several predefined actions. These will gradually transition to utilize the Floating Menu rendering and scripting engine making them more flexible and robust by streamlining maintenance &amp; future development.</p>

<p>Additionally, the upcoming (entirely new) version of the iOS BTT Remote app will be capable of rendering your custom Floating Menus on your iPhone or iPad. </p>

<p>You can find various Floating Menu examples on <a href="https://share.folivora.ai" rel="nofollow">share.folivora.ai</a>. For example have a look at the Notch menu, which is invisible by default but expands from your Macbook’s Notch on hover. Another nice example is the “Mini Emoji Menu” preset: it places a little transparent dot on the left edge of the active window, which, when hovered, shows multiple custom emoji which you can insert by clicking.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.folivora.ai/docs/1600_floating_menus.html" rel="nofollow">documentation for this new feature</a> is already available, and you can always come to <a href="https://community.folivora.ai/c/floatingmenus/18" rel="nofollow">the community site</a> to discuss or request features. Now that I have a solid working base, I can easily built on it, so please report any bugs and request any feature you can think of!</p>

<title>Sanebox, your email concierge [Sponsor]</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I’ve said before, I’m a long time user and lover of Sanebox. Thanks to them for sponsoring again this week. Here’s a user story from Thomas Yuan.</p>

<p><a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p>Well, here’s a funny thing: I started using SaneBox because my email was an utter disaster, and I needed something to save me from the deluge. Little did I know that I was stepping into a world where email isn’t just manageable, it’s… well, sane. I know, I know…</p>

<p>SaneBox is like having your own personal email concierge. It’s not just a filter - oh no, that’s underselling it. It’s like a highly-trained butler who goes through your mail, knows what’s important, and presents you with only the choicest pieces of correspondence.</p>

<p>Everything else? Neatly sorted away, out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p>Setting up SaneBox is as easy as pie. And I’m not talking about some complicated lattice-top apple pie here. I mean one of those simple, comforting pumpkin pies. You just connect your email account, and voila, SaneBox starts its magic. It learns from your actions, your patterns, tailoring its sorting to your specific needs.</p>

<p>Now, the main feature here is the @SaneLater folder. It’s like a second inbox, except it’s where all the non-urgent emails go to hang out. Newsletter from that one store you bought socks from 3 years ago? That’s a @SaneLater item. Automated system alert about a software update? You bet that’s going in @SaneLater.</p>

<p>What’s more, you can customize it to your heart’s content. There’s @SaneBlackHole for those pesky emails you never want to see again, and @SaneNews for newsletters and the like. You can even create your own folders, and SaneBox will learn to sort your emails accordingly.</p>

<p>And don’t get me started on @SaneReminders. Ever sent an email and needed a reminder if nobody replies? Just CC or BCC to 1week@sanebox.com, and if there’s no reply in a week, it pops back up in your inbox. It’s like a boomerang made out of pure organizational power.</p>

<p>Sure, there are other email management tools out there. But SaneBox stands out for its simplicity, its flexibility, and, most of all, its effectiveness. It’s like it took my unruly, wild-west email inbox and turned it into a sleek, streamlined, email-answering machine. And, in a world where every spare minute counts, who wouldn’t want that?</p>

<p>So, if you’ve got an email inbox that’s more like a black hole, give SaneBox a whirl. I promise you, you won’t be disappointed. It’s affordable, efficient, and pretty darn fun to use.</p>

<p>And here’s a pro tip: if you’re ever unsure about a feature, just explore their help center. It’s packed with useful guides and tips. It’s like the cherry on top of the SaneBox sundae.</p>

<p>SaneBox isn’t just a tool, it’s a lifestyle change. It’s a way to take back control of your inbox and, by extension, your digital life. It’s helped me, and I’m pretty sure it’ll help you too. So why wait? Start living the sane way today.</p>

<p>Sanebox is an inexpensive choice. You can get a free trial to experience the difference in email management without any commitment. Plus, the app offers flexible monthly plans starting at just $7.</p>

<p>My cat died a couple weeks ago. I had him for 20 years and he’s left a large hole in my life. I know not everybody gets cats the way cat people do, but he was honestly one of my closest friends. I just wanted to write a bit about him now that the grief is a bit less raw and just remember him for the legend he was.</p>

<p>My ex and I were around when Yeti’s mom had her litter. She had health problems and sadly had to be euthanized shortly after Yeti and his siblings were weaned. I had my pick of the litter. I had recently lost a tuxedo cat (Trouble) to a pit bull attack, and thought I’d take the one tuxedo in the litter. Aditi’s mom suggested I also take this one bashful kitten who had a hairline similar to mine. I agreed. Jezebel (the Tuxedo) became Aditi’s cat, and Yeti almost immediately became very bonded to me. I’ve always been thankful I was talked into taking him.</p>

<p>Both Yeti and Jezebel were polydactyl, and Yeti’s front paws had six toes each. I almost named him Big Foot, but given his long, thick white hair, “Yeti” seemed more apropos.</p>

<p>Yeti displayed what can only be anthropomorphized as “empathy.” He always understood when I was sad or sick and would lay by me, placing one paw on my thigh, or curl up on the couch behind me and put his paw on my shoulder. And when I was happy or comfortable, he would be in my lap. He loved to sit facing me with his paws on my chest and give me nose bumps. He learned very young that licking my nose repeatedly was a bit painful, and would just give one lick or tap and then stop.</p>

<p>Speaking of understanding pain, Yeti learned at a very young age that his claws and teeth hurt me, and after he got past the part of his life where he would try to climb my leg with his sharp little kitten claws, he never bit or scratched anybody, ever. I once held him while a urinary crystal was removed through his urethra; he held onto my arm and yowled, but never clawed or bit, which was impressive. I think if someone was squeezing a rock through my private bits I would probably try to bite the nearest arm I could.</p>

<p>Jezebel passed away under the care of Aditi a few years back. We honestly never expected Yeti to outlive her, but he lived to 19 years and 9 months and I enjoyed every minute of it. I’ve spent more time with Yeti than with any human in my entire life. He was always around. I never even saw my parents that much from 0-18. And I’ve never had a romantic relationship longer than about 13 years. So Yeti was my longest relationship and the “partner” I’ve spent the most of my life with. I appreciate humans and all, but Yeti and I never had a fight or even a misunderstanding. He was just always there for me. I gave him all my love, and he returned it.</p>

<p>Yeti has been living with my partner Elle and I for about 5 years now. It took him a while, but he eventually accepted Elle as his other person. He worked his way into her heart and Elle loved him as much as I did. He helped pull our little “family” together, and I know she’s missing him right now, too.</p>

<p>The last couple years have been full of health scares. He went from 20 pounds to 6 pounds at the end. He had a bout of pancreatitis, and then kidney failure. We’d been expecting him to die for quite a while now, so we had plenty of time to prepare for this. And he gave me the best ending I could imagine…</p>

<p>He was energetic and loving on Thursday, and then at 2am on Friday he crawled under my covers and fell asleep. That was the last time he moved on his own. He spent the day with me Friday, with his paw in my hand or on my leg. I would place him in the middle of the couch and then work on my laptop on the side, and he would pull himself over to me to put his paw on me or bury his head in my thigh. I took him to bed with me that night. On Saturday at 5:15am, I rolled over and put my hand on him. He took two deep breaths and then exhaled his last. Man, he waited until I woke up to say goodbye. Seriously, he was the most caring cat you’ll ever meet.</p>

<p>I will always miss Yeti, but he gave me a great 20 years in the prime of my life. I’m not nearly as devastated as I thought I’d be. It was all so peaceful. He stayed by me all the way to the end, and I’ll be eternally grateful that he passed peacefully at home and I didn’t have to make the decision to end his life in a cold vet’s office. I’ve done that with beloved pets a dozen times over the years, and it’s a horrible thing to go through. Yeti gave me a fairy tale of an ending.</p>

<p>I made a video out of 20 years’ worth of pictures. It’s too long, but if you want to enjoy it and have the patience for it, consider it my tribute to the best cat ever.</p>

<title>Snibbets 2.0.34</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16195268/snibbets-2-dot-0-34</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16195268/snibbets-2-dot-0-34</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I released a new version of
<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a> this morning that solves one
peculiarity: if you have multiple snippets in one file but any of them
don’t contain code blocks, then the titles and display would get weird.</p>

<p>Now you can have sections of a snippet file (separated by ATX headers)
that contain just notes. If a section contains just notes and no code,
then the notes will be output for that section, even when not using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--notes</code> or having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all_notes: true</code> set in config.</p>

<p>This just allows for uses of Snibbets as both a note reference and a
snippet manager. It probably won’t effect people who are using it “as
intended,” but opens up new use cases.</p>

<p>To get the latest version, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install snibbets</code>. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">project
page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>Doing with multiple sections</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16160573/doing-with-multiple-sections</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16160573/doing-with-multiple-sections</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Funny story: I got a feature request for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a> to allow multiple sections to be specified in the output, but I misread the notification as a request for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/" title="doing - BrettTerpstra.com">Doing</a>. So I spent a couple hours adding multiple section handling to an array of Doing commands and happily reported the result to the user, who was very confused by the version number I gave him. I apologized and have now added multiple section handling to mdless, which was a <em>lot</em> less work than adding it to Doing. So I might as well write a blog post about the Doing feature nobody asked for, I guess.</p>

<p>Most of Doing’s many commands allow for the specification of a particular section, e.g. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show</code> command can limit its results to just one section, or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag</code> command can tag the last X entries from a given section. Now, almost all of these commands can take multiple sections, either specified as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s section1,section2</code> or by using multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s</code> flags in the same command, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing show -s currently -s later</code>.</p>

<p>This allows a little more flexibility, especially for display commands. It also means you can perform actions on a more limited set of entries without limiting it to just a single set. It (obviously) doesn’t apply to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">now</code> command or other entry commands because an entry can only be in one section.</p>

<p>By the way, section names are fuzzy matched, so you can specify that you want results from both Currently and Later (assuming you have such sections) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s curr,lat</code>.</p>

<p>If I expand this further, I’ll allow negative arguments as well, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing show -s -archive</code> to exclude the Archive section. But for now it’s just multiple sections.</p>

<p>That’s all for now, just figured I’d mention it since I put the effort into it. You can update to the latest with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install doing</code> (which might require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code>, depending on your setup).</p>

<p>This post will only be of interest to those using the <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a> (<abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr>), specifically with the lefthand <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/product/keycluster">key cluster module</a>. I recently added some customizations I thought might be worth mentioning to those who happen to have this setup. For those who don’t, maybe read on and be tempted by the possibilities…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent">Agent software</a> for the <abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr> allows the definition of up to four additional Function layers, or sets of keys that are mapped when a modifier is held down. You’re probably used to the Mod layer, which is how you turn I/J/K/L into arrow keys, etc. when you hold the Mod key, and the Fn layer, which turns 1 into F1 when you hold the Fn key. By clicking the down arrow on the layer bar, you can now check boxes next to Fn2-Fn5 layers to enable them. Then you can assign keys to trigger them, which is where the key cluster module comes in.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="enable-layers-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="315" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/enable-layers-800.jpg" title="enable-layers-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The key cluster module provides 3 extra keys to the right of your B key and Space key (by default it’s the Mod key, but I swap my Mod and Space keys). I initially assigned these to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> on the top (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-B"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">B</kbd></span> when Mod is held, creating Run and Build buttons in Xcode and other IDEs, and a Refresh button in most other apps), and Enter and Backspace on the bottom two keys (Numpad Return and Forward Delete when Mod or Fn is held). But then I realized they could further function as triggers for other layers.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            

<p>You can assign a secondary function to any key, which is an action that’s performed when it’s held while another key is pressed. For example, I change the default Mouse key into Caps Lock (which becomes my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2015/12/18/a-hyper-key-that-can-still-yell/" title="A Hyper Key that can still YELL">Hyper key</a> along with <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" title="Karabiner-Elements">Karabiner Elements</a>), and use the secondary function on the Tab key so that when it’s held in combination with other keys, it triggers the Mouse layer.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="tab-mouse.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="426" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/tab-mouse.jpg" title="tab-mouse.jpg" width="689" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The bottom left key of the module is a very natural reach for the left thumb, and was the first layer I created. I added a Fn2 layer, and then assigned the secondary function of that key to trigger the Fn2 layer when held. Now I can map anything on the right side, and on the left side I can map anything easily reached by my remaining fingers when my left thumb is holding the module key down.</p>

<p>I assigned A-G (home row) keys to F20-F24, which I then use with BetterTouchTool to trigger actions. I also assigned the block of keys from Y-O down to N-. on the right side to produce characters I commonly use in coding, such as curly/square/angle brackets. It took a while to get used to using those instead of reaching for the actual keys, but it does speed things up with a little practice.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="fn2keymap-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="396" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/fn2keymap-800.jpg" title="fn2keymap-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />

              </noscript>
            
<p>Then I added a Fn3 layer, and made it so that when the right bottom button of the module was held, the other two buttons turn into PgUp and PgDown, and B and Space turn into Home and End. This is essentially the same as holding down my (repositioned) right Mod key and using the arrow cluster on my right hand, but gives me easy one-handed left-handed scrolling while my right hand is on the trackpad. I haven’t added anything else to that layer yet.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="fwd-back.jpg" class="alignright" height="229" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/fwd-back.jpg" title="fwd-back.jpg" width="272" />
              </noscript>
            
<p>The top key on the module triggers the Fn4 layer, which simply turns the bottom two keys into <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-["><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">[</kbd></span> and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-]"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">]</kbd></span> for forward back navigation.</p>

<p>I’ll expand the Fn3/4 keymaps as I find needs for them, but one step at a time. I’ve made the mistake of programming complex layers (and entire other keymaps) and then having to make extensive cheat sheets to remember where everything is until I develop muscle memory for them.</p>

<p>Bonus tip: The Fn layer by default only affects the number keys, so there’s a whole lot of room for mapping other functions to letter keys. I turn a block of keys on the right to be media controls:</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="media-keys.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="351" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/media-keys.jpg" title="media-keys.jpg" width="459" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>I hope that provides some interesting ideas for your own customizations. If you’re interested in this kind of thing but haven’t looked into the <abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr>, I highly recommend <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">checking it out</a>. Splurge on the wrist wrests and the key module!</p>

<p>Not so long ago I wrote a little script that would generate an HTML playground of any MacOS app’s menu bar, primarily for the purpose of generating screenshots. It has a full automation API and you can script screenshots with fuzzy name matching, meaning menu items names and positions can change and your automated screenshots will still work. It’s a very specific use case, but I shared it because it took way too much time and I would love it if it helped even one other person.</p>

<p>Yesterday I updated the menu styling to match Ventura, which uses new submenu indicators, slightly smaller font sizes by default, and slight changes to background opacity and hue. The results should look like a passable rendition of the latest operating system now. You can <a href="https://ttscoff.github.io/niftymenu/Pages.html">check out the demo here</a>.</p>

<p>NiftyMenu also got <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/niftymenu">its own project page</a> on this site, with full documentation and installation instructions.</p>

<p>Thanks to SaneBox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I don’t know what I would do without it.</p>

<p>Ever feel like you’re drowning in a sea of emails? You’re not alone. We know the struggle of managing important emails while fighting spam messages with flashy sales. For every 10 emails from sources you don’t even remember subscribing to, you get one important one. When you find it, it feels like you’ve already finished a long task, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Finding important messages shouldn’t feel like a battle between you and your inbox. In fact, why do you have to sort through all these unimportant files in the first place?</p>

<p>In a world of relentless digital communication, email overload is a common struggle. But SaneBox can help you to conquer your inbox once and for all! Using AI, SaneBox learns your email habits and sorts incoming messages precisely, so you can achieve the ultimate victory: a perfectly organized inbox.</p>

<p>Let’s explore this service in a quick overview!</p>

<h3 id="why-sanebox-stands-out">Why SaneBox Stands Out</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI-Powered:</strong> SaneBox’s algorithms learn your email behavior and customize your inbox management experience. So, if you want to see your favorite brand’s discounts in the same inbox as your collaborator’s messages, you’ve got it!</li>
  <li><strong>Personalized Prioritization:</strong> High-priority emails stay in your main inbox, while lower-priority messages move to a separate folder for later review.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus-Driven Features:</strong> With tools like Do Not Disturb, you can pause incoming emails and concentrate on your tasks without distractions. You can come back to them whenever you’re ready.</li>
  <li><strong>Universal Compatibility:</strong> SaneBox works with any email service. So whether you’re using Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook, you can tame that inbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-sanebox-features">Key SaneBox Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Smart Filtering:</strong> Automatically sorts emails based on your habits and priorities as soon as they reach your inbox. It’s like having a personal assistant to filter your inbox (but without the awkward daily interactions).</li>
  <li><strong>SaneNoReplies:</strong> Tracks messages you’ve sent without a response, making it easy to follow up.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Folders:</strong> Organize your emails effortlessly with custom-made folders for all your categories and priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to pricing, Sanebox is an inexpensive choice. You can get a free trial to experience the difference in email management without any commitment. Plus, the app offers flexible monthly plans starting at just $7. It’s really that affordable!</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a> to handle this blog’s RSS feeds. It reads my statically-generated RSS feed and gives me subscriber stats, as well as the ability to send new posts to social media endpoints. But it lacks Mastodon integration, and I’m spending most of my time on Mastodon lately (find me at <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff" title="Mastodon/ttscoff@nojack.easydns.ca">@ttscoff@nojack.easydns.ca</a>). So I wanted my new posts on this blog to automatically post to Mastodon. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">script in this post</a> could be used with any blog that generates an RSS feed, but is mostly geared toward static blogs.</p>

<p>I got started with a post from Dr. Drang called <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2022/11/announcing-new-posts-on-mastodon/">“Announcing New Posts on Mastodon”</a>. It included a Python script that I referenced to create a Ruby script for my needs. Thanks to the Doc for getting me started!</p>

<p>You can find the script <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">here</a>. See below for configuration and usage.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<p>To configure the script, at minimum, you need your Mastodon endpoint and an auth key. Your endpoint is generally your Mastodon instance URL with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/v1/statuses</code> appended to it, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://mastodon.social/api/v1/statuses</code>. I’m not sure if this is ever not the case. The auth key can be generated by going to your Mastodon homepage, clicking the Settings gear icon, and choosing Development. Create a new application with any name, your blog url as the website, and leave the Redirect URI as is. Make sure it at least has permission to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write:statuses</code>. You’ll then see a client key, a client secret, and an access token. All you need is the access token for this script.</p>

<p>Set up the script by updating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTODON_ENDPOINT</code> (as described above) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTODON_AUTH</code> (with your access token).</p>

<p>You’ll also need to configure the RSS feed. The script can parse JSON or XML feeds of your blog (local files or URLs) to find the latest post. If you want to use a JSON feed, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON_FEED</code> to either a local JSON file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> is fine for your HOME directory) or a JSON feed url. If you’re using an XML feed, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON_FEED</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, and set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSS_FEED</code> to either a local file or url. With FeedPress, my JSON is generated from my XML and both feeds can take a few minutes to update, and the most immediate list of posts I have is the local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom.xml</code> file generated with my site, so that’s what I have mine set to. That way I can run this script immediately after a new deploy and still get the latest post.</p>

<p>The rest of the settings in the script are the template used for the status (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST_TEMPLATE</code>), an optional query string that can be appended to the URL for campaign tracking, etc. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUERY_STRING</code>), and then a few options for updating front matter. I imagine most people won’t need the front matter bit, but the options are commented if you need them.</p>

<p>It records what it posts to a local JSON file (location set with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TOOTS_DB</code>), so it won’t post the same thing twice. Optionally, it can go back and add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mastodon: [TOOT_URL]</code> key to the original Markdown for the post. I’m using this to render a Mastodon link on each post that links to the toot so that people can reply/share it from their Mastodon account (since Mastodon doesn’t/can’t offer a “Toot This” link the way Twitter can, as far as I know)<sup id="fnref:js"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:js" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. For most people this step is probably unnecessary, and can be disabled entirely by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADD_FRONT_MATTER</code> constant at the top of the script to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>All of the necessary config is commented, should be pretty easy to get running. Rather than rely on Ruby’s Net/HTTP library, it just uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> to make the call, so you need a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> binary available (this is default on most systems).</p>

<p>To use the script, save it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toot.rb</code> and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x toot.rb</code> on it. If properly configured, you can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb</code> to toot the latest post from your feed. If you want to test, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--debug</code> (or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d</code>), and it will set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibility=direct</code> parameter that will make the resulting Mastodon post show up only for you (private).</p>

<p>You can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb --last-ten</code> to toot the last 10 posts. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb -h</code> to see available options.</p>

<p>By default, when the script creates a new toot, it will notify you on STDERR. It will also output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW_TOOT: [TOOT_URI]</code> to STDOUT, which is what I use to detect whether a new toot was created and trigger a rebuild. You can disable all output with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--silent</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s</code>).</p>

<h3 id="updating-front-matter">Updating Front Matter</h3>

<p>If you want to use the front matter updating “as is” in the script, it requires that your blog posts be named to match the url. It takes the url path, substitutes slashes for dashes, and removes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and any trailing slash from the url to create the slug, then adds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. So if your post is at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/2023/04/21/im-on-shrooms-like-right-now/</code>, the resulting file it will look for is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2023-04-21-im-on-shrooms-like-right-now.md</code>. If your naming scheme is anything else, it would require manual editing to work.</p>

<p>For reference, I have this script run as part of my Rakefile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:deploy</code> task. Once the site is fully deployed, it runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toot.rb</code> and toots the latest post. If the script returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW_TOOT</code> on STDOUT (meaning the post has never been tooted before and the front matter for the tooted post has been updated), it will re-render and deploy the site again so that the Mastodon link on the newest post goes live. Presumably, although that’s about to be tested when I publish this post. It’s a bit of a hacky workaround, but I can’t toot it until the post is live, and I can’t get the Mastodon link until it’s tooted, so it takes twice to get it right. It will only ever toot a post once, so updates and re-renders won’t be doubled.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:generate_deploy</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<h3 id="in-closing">In Closing</h3>

<p>I hope that FeedPress eventually adds Mastodon sharing to its social services, but my current setup really likes having the actual URL for the associated Mastodon post available, so that wouldn’t do much good in this scenario anyway. I hope this script is helpful to other people using static blog setups and wanting Mastodon integration.</p>

<p>If you do generate your own RSS feed and don’t currently get statistics from it, I do recommend checking out <a href="https://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a>. It’s affordable, and great for blogs and podcasts.</p>

<p>Again, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">find the script in this gist</a>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:js">
      <p>I considered just using JavaScript to load the JSON record that this script creates and inject a Mastodon link on the front end (avoiding multiple renders), but for a few reasons decided I’d rather add a hardcoded link at render time. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:js">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Markdown to Bike conversion</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16078222/markdown-to-bike-conversion</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16078222/markdown-to-bike-conversion</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m liking outlining in Jesse Grossjean’s latest app, <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/">Bike</a>, for my outlining needs. It’s a simple outliner that can save the content of its outlines to Bike files, OPML documents, or plain text. And its native document format is plain HTML that’s easy to work with.</p>

<p>As an aside, Jesse just released Shortcut actions for Bike, making it possible to do some automation of Bike and Bike documents. I haven’t played around with it much yet, but if you’re into Shortcuts, <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/bike-automate-with-shortcuts/">check out what’s available</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that Bike lacks is an easy way to convert Markdown lists to Bike outlines. It can actually read indented plain text just fine, but the list markers are included in the node text, and blank lines become empty nodes instead of being compressed. Running a list through a Markdown processor and saving as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bike</code> can often create an invalid file, as Bike requires every list item to contain a paragraph tag, not bare text.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I initially played around with running Markdown through a Markdown processor and then manipulating the output, but ultimately went with a much simpler version that compresses newlines and removes list markers, putting the resulting indented text in your clipboard. Pasting the result into a Bike document should almost always yield the expected result.</p>

              </noscript>
            

<p>Save the script below as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md_to_bike</code> in your PATH and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x path/to/md_to_bike</code>. It can be called as a pipe or on a file. To call it as a pipe, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat myfile.md | md_to_bike</code>. To call it on a file, just provide the path to the file as an argument: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mmd_to_bike path/to/myfile.md</code>. The results will be placed in your clipboard, ready to paste into a Bike document.</p>

<p>Over 20 years of writing scripts and apps I’ve collected a lot of “snippets” of code that I save whenever I solve a problem and think I’ll want the solution again in the future. I like these snippets to include notes and links, and I need to be able to easily search them and grab the code when I need it without much effort. That’s why I wrote Snibbets <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/04/29/markdown-and-code-snippet-management/">back in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve now refactored Snibbets as a gem and vastly improved its capabilities. I wanted the simplicity of creating snippets in nvUltra and searching them quickly from the command line, getting just the code I need with a few keystrokes. I keep iTerm in Visor mode, so it’s a hotkey away, and just as convenient as any quick find panel in a dedicated snippet management app.</p>

<p>Snibbets now has <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">its own project page</a> where you can read all about its features and options. You can also see all the code, file bug reports, and make feature requests <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/snibbets">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Here’s a quick overview, though.</p>

<h3 id="snippets-are-markdown-files">Snippets Are Markdown Files</h3>

<p>A snippet is just a Markdown file, where the filename becomes the title, optionally with additional extensions that help the syntax highlighter, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">symbolize hash keys.rb.md</code>. The document can contain tags in MultiMarkdown metadata format, titles as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> headlines, additional notes, and the code snippet either indented or fenced with optional language specifier. A single document can contain multiple snippets, separated with headlines as titles for each one.</p>

<p>Snippets all go into one folder. You don’t need to organize them into directories, that would defeat the purpose of the full text search in Snibbets. You can open that directory in any app that can handle it, such as nvUltra or Obsidian, and have full access for editing and creating new snippets.</p>

              </video>
            </figure>

<h3 id="searching-your-snippets">Searching Your Snippets</h3>

<p>To search your snippets, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets SEARCH TERMS</code>. It will use a combination of Spotlight, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to find matches. If there’s more than one match, you’ll get a menu, and if the selected file contains more than one snippet, you’ll get a second menu. The code from the snippet is output to the console without any accompanying notes.</p>

<p>You can run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--edit</code> to open the selected snippet in your editor to see all of the notes or update the code. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--nvultra</code> to open the snippet in nvUltra, assuming you’re on the beta. You can also run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--copy</code> to copy just the code to your clipboard in addition to displaying it in the console. Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets -h</code> to see all available options.</p>

<h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3>

<p>When multiple results/snippets are detected, a menu is generated. If you have <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" title="junegunn/fzf:A command-line fuzzy finder">fzf</a> installed, it will be used for the menu, allowing fuzzy searching to narrow results. If you don’t have fzf but do have <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum" title="charmbracelet/gum:A tool for glamorous shell scripts 🎀">gum</a> installed, that will be used and is almost as good for this purpose. Failing that, Snibbets will generate its own menu and you’ll have to enter a number to get the snippet. fzf and gum are far superior, so I recommend installing one or the other.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<p>I put a lot of time into syntax highlighting. You can use either Pygments or Skylighting (separate installations), and you can configure the theme. Syntax definitions are picked up from the filename and from language specifiers on fenced code blocks. It looks really great using Skylighting and the Nord theme (as shown in the video above). To enable this, edit your config (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets --configure</code>) to include:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">highlight</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
<span class="na">highlighter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">skylighting</span>
<span class="na">highlight_theme</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">nord</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Snibbets will avoid highlighting anything going to the clipboard or being piped or redirected to other commands. Keeps things tidy.</p>

<p>It’s a simple tool<sup id="fnref:simple"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:simple" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but it makes it feasible for me to store all of my code snippets in a way that allows nvUltra to become my main code snippet manager, and gives me instant access to any snippet from the command line. Just what I needed.</p>

<title>Syntax highlighting is fun, and you won't believe this one weird trick</title>

<p>Over the last couple of days I got obsessed with wrangling my code snippet collection, once again. It’s not healthy, but it is what it is. I dug back into Snibbets, a tool for managing code snippets as plain text Markdown files that <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/04/29/markdown-and-code-snippet-management/">I started back in 2020</a>. I actually got it to a really good point today, but I’m realizing that it’s getting bloated enough that it needs to become a gem before I’m ready to hype it up. The current version and mostly-up-to-date documentation are <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/snibbets">up on GitHub</a>, though, so feel free to peek in the meantime.</p>

<p>But that’s not what I’m here to tell you about. In the process of working on Snibbets, I wrote a little routine that could turn a file extension into a programming language name for tagging purposes, and vice versa. It seemed ripe for making a little one-off utility, so I’ve <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/14560a71b86a48b4d895087d3700f516">posted a standalone version to GitHub</a>. I’m going to be using it when I’m doing technical writing and including code samples in languages I don’t usually work with. When you create a fenced code block, you can add a “lexer” to the opening fence, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~~ruby</code>, which helps most platforms with properly syntax highlighting it. But then I find myself working on someone else’s Terraform code and I’m unsure whether that’s a supported language for syntax highlighting. Now I can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexers.rb terraform</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexers.rb tf</code> and it will tell me all about it. What the available lexers are, what common extensions are associated with it, you know, the works.</p>

<p>I built this by taking the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmentize -L lexers</code> and running it through a few regular expressions to make a parseable data set. Then I took the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skylighting -l</code> to add a few more lexers (though those don’t have extensions listed and I don’t know many of the more obscure ones, so that data serves to search for a valid lexer, but nothing else). The script itself just builds a queryable object out of the data and offers a few different ways to get at the data (you can see the whole set at the bottom of the script). The easiest way to use it is like I mentioned above: just pass a file extension or language name to it as an argument and it will give you back the info you need. There’s more documentation in the comments of the script.</p>

<p>Just thought I’d share it! <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/14560a71b86a48b4d895087d3700f516">Check out the gist</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<title>I forgot about the Titlecase API</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16070204/i-forgot-about-the-titlecase-api</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16070204/i-forgot-about-the-titlecase-api</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I made a little web service back in 2015 and somewhere in the following 7 years I forgot about it. I’ve been adding title-casing to various projects and plugins and keep writing new code for it… which was the whole reason I built the API to begin with.</p>

<p>It just accepts a text string and returns an AP titlecased version as plain text. That’s it. No bells or whistles, but if you need to incorporate title casing into a script or a Shortcut or anything else that can make a quick call to the web, it’s a great answer.</p>

<p>Just make a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/?title=the%20text%20to%20titlecase</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title=</code> contains the url encoded string you want to title case. You can play with it <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/test">on the test page</a>, which will also show you the url to use to get the same result.</p>

<p>That’s all. It’s a silly little thing, but if I’ve forgotten about it, I bet everyone else did, too, and it might just be handy for someone.</p>

<title>Just checking in</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16068629/just-checking-in</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16068629/just-checking-in</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I haven’t been posting much besides sponsored posts and web excursions for a while now. I figured it was time for a checkin for the sake of those who check this blog regularly, and especially for the benefit of those who <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/support/">offer financial support</a> to me and all my projects.</p>

<p>As you probably know, I have bipolar disorder. Most of my project releases and blogging spurts correlate with manic episodes. And manic episodes are bad for me — they result in a severe sleep deficit that is shortening my life. But I’ve been remarkably stable lately, the downside of which is no late night coding/creating binges or the inescapable bursting of ideas that I just have to share with the world. It means I do my job, I maintain and support my commercial software, I fix reported bugs in my free projects, and I go to bed. It doesn’t lead to a lot of fun software releases, blog posts, or new ideas in general. Sleep is good, stagnation kills me.</p>

<p>I’ve recently been realizing that my version of “stable” is more akin to depression. The thing is, I can’t take antidepressants without risking triggering a manic phase, which leaves me in a position where I either have to be depressed, or deal with the life-shortening effects of constant mood fluctuation. But I think I have a potential solution…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>I removed the meat of this post because it was causing friction with my loved ones. I don’t want my activities to cause any undue harm, so I’ll save further sharing on this topic until everything is… decriminalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>So that’s my check-in for now. You can hear more up-to-the-minute updates on my progress (as well as Jeff and Christina’s) by tuning into the Mental Health Corner on <a href="https://overtiredpod.com/">Overtired</a>. I appreciate all of the support (monetary, pull requests, and even just kind emails) that you all have continued to provide for me. It really helps me stay motivated to maintain my 100+ projects and create new stuff!</p>

<title>Find which of your favorite apps are on Setapp, revisited</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16056931/find-which-of-your-favorite-apps-are-on-setapp-revisited</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16056931/find-which-of-your-favorite-apps-are-on-setapp-revisited</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Back in 2019 I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/22/so-you-got-setapp-dot-dot-dot-make-the-most-of-it/">wrote a little script</a> that would parse your Applications folder and tell you which of your apps were available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a>. The goal was to help you figure out which apps you were already using that were also on Setapp, so you could use the Setapp version and direct a little of your subscription fee to your favorite developers.</p>

<p>The script parses the setapps/apps page to see what apps are available, and the markup has changed since I originally wrote the script. Thankfully, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cplater/110138170935239070#.">Chuck Plater</a> updated the script <a href="https://gist.github.com/caplater/96467af7041f34367895b7b1170f5589">in a fork</a> to work with the current markup. I’ve implemented his changes in <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/70f6dec1fa12d96c8af3f8b5b3b7e14b">the original script</a> and it’s once again working fine.</p>

<p>To use the script, save it to a text file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onsetapp.rb</code>, then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x onsetapp.rb</code> on it. Once you’ve done that, you should be able to execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./onsetapp.rb</code> and get a list of applications you use that are also available on Setapp.</p>

<p>Thanks to Chuck for the fix. I hope all Setapp subscribers will go to the trouble of using the Setapp version of apps they already own, it really does help the developers (and this script makes it easy). If you’re not already a Setapp user, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">here’s my affiliate link</a> to start using hundreds of apps for $10 a month.</p>

<p>Thanks to Curio for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week!</p>

<p>What if your digital notebook allowed you to create at-a-glance dashboards and checklists using queries to pull in and consolidate information from all across your project into lists, mind maps, or Kanban collections?</p>

<p>We call them <em>Smart Collections</em> and that’s what we’re introducing in <a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Curio 25 Professional</a>, the latest release of our flagship note-taking and brainstorming app for macOS.</p>

<p>Create a new list, mind map, or Kanban stack then specify a query expression. Immediately it will dynamically fill itself with matching figures from across your notebook. A query can be as simple as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">starts soon</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#remind</code> or as sophisticated as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(@george priority&gt;4) or due&lt;2w or #active group:priority</code>.</p>

<p>Even better, these dynamic collections contain <em>live</em> instances of the original figures. Edit an item’s text or change dates, tags, or other meta attributes, and those changes are instantly reflected back to the original figures.</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Smart Collections</em>, Curio 25’s Search shelf has been completely overhauled to support this powerful query language. And the query language itself, also used by Curio’s instant <em>Quick Find</em> feature, has been greatly extended with even more functionality to help you find exactly what you’re looking for.</p>

<p><a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Curio</a>, first introduced almost 20 years ago, is the most advanced notebook application for note-taking, brainstorming, and research. It provides all the tools and functionality you need to be more productive and get stuff done.</p>

<p>New traditional license purchasers can save 20% using the code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code>. <a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Visit zengobi.com to learn more today!</a></p>
