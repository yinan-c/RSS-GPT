<p>The House Financial Services Committee debated a CFPB rule that could add further uncertainty to the digital asset space. Republicans criticized the rule as ambiguous, anti-innovation, and outside the CFPB's authority. While some Democrats appear in agreement with Republican claims that the rule is unclear, Democrat leadership on the Committee argued the rule bolsters consumer protections and regulatory parity between banks and nonbanks. In a new letter, two Members urged the SEC not to approve any more crypto ETPs. And in the White House's new budget proposal, President Biden is once again supporting a digital asset mining tax and crypto-related updates to the tax code, like applying wash sale rules to crypto assets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has propelled BTC to unprecedented levels, igniting a memecoin resurgence that has outperformed many sectors. This revival shines a light on both legacy tokens like DOGE and SHIB, which have seen gains over 100%, and newer tokens like PEPE and WIF, soaring over 600%. With most meme tokens trading strictly onchain, data analytics is crucial for spotting trends and momentum, helping investors differentiate between tokens with lasting potential and those destined for fleeting popularity.</p>

<div><h2><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Pyth <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $5.5 billion in value</strong> and supports price feeds of cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities on 162 protocols across <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a><strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>In February 2024, Pyth oracle transactions accounted for an average of 20% of total Solana transactions;</strong> simultaneously, Pyth data providers paid $225,000 in fees on Solana in February 2024.</li><li>Pyth Network uses a network of first-party data providers that publish data directly to Solana and Pythnet (an appchain that serves Pyth oracle updates to all other blockchains). <strong>Data providers include institutional traders, renowned market makers, and notable DeFi protocols, such as Jane Street, CTC, and Raydium.</strong></li><li>By the end of Q2, <strong>Pyth plans to fully migrate its Solana push oracle to a new Solana pull oracle.</strong></li><li><strong>As Solana’s leading oracle, Pyth will support many of the applications expanding to and launching on Eclipse,</strong> the first SVM-based Layer-2 blockchain on Ethereum.</li></ul><h2>Background</h2><p>Blockchain applications often use data from the external world. However, the design of these systems restricts them from natively interacting with external data without help. As a resolution, blockchains rely on oracles to act as middlemen that aggregate external data and make it available for onchain application use.</p><p>Typically, oracle networks incentivize nodes to find certain information, come to a consensus on a value for particular data points, and publish such values to blockchains in set time periods. However, this “push” model can be indirect, expensive, and hard to scale. Pyth Network addresses these issues by fostering a network of primary source (first-party) data providers and coordinating a “pull” model. This model reduces latency, scales quickly, and lowers network costs by offloading update fees to data consumers (applications and developers).</p><p>Pyth (<a href="https://messari.io/project/pyth-network">PYTH</a>) is an oracle network that aims to offer accurate prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities. It offers three core products:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">Price Feeds</a> (live updates for smart contracts)</li><li><a href="https://pyth.network/benchmarks">Benchmarks</a> (historical market data)</li><li><a href="https://pyth.network/blog/secure-random-numbers-for-blockchains">Pyth Entropy</a> (secure random number generator)</li></ul><p>The robustness of Pyth’s data is largely due to its contributing publisher network, which comprises nearly <a href="https://pyth.network/publishers">100 data providers</a> from global exchanges, trading firms, market makers, institutions, and DeFi. A few notable providers include Jane Street, Chicago Trading Company (CTC), Binance, Raydium, Osmosis, Galaxy, and 0x. Pyth is focused on making financial market data available to developers on an expanding list of blockchain networks (<a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a> as of writing).</p><p><a href="https://pyth.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/PythNetwork">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/PythNetwork">Discord</a></p><h2>Technology</h2><p>In addition to bridging data between blockchains and the outside world, oracles strive to overcome the <a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/2959">oracle problem</a>. The oracle problem refers to ensuring secure, authenticated, and trustworthy external data, while also considering the potential failures of external sources.</p><p>Addressing the oracle problem typically involves:</p><ul><li>Validators or oracle nodes sourcing data</li><li>Nodes cryptographically signing (verifying) the sourced data</li><li>Aggregation of the data and consensus of the calculated data point</li><li>Data transmission to the blockchain network</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/082cf846315eca2ec4c0a38045809cf6e679ec74-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>The oracle problem is often addressed via a push or pull model. Most oracles use a third-party <strong><em>push model</em></strong>. In this model, oracle nodes are third parties that fetch data from either primary sources (i.e., exchanges) or secondary sources (i.e., data aggregators like CoinGecko and Kaiko). For instance, Chainlink’s primary price feed oracle nodes fetch data from <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">secondary sources</a>. Push oracles push price updates to individual blockchains at set intervals, paying gas costs for every onchain update. Adding price feeds or decreasing latency between onchain updates incurs more costs for the oracle network, impeding its ability to scale. Additionally, fetching data requires multiple trust assumptions: the primary source is correct and stable; the secondary source is correct and stable; and the oracle network is stable.</p><p>Pyth Network confronts the shortcomings of the third-party push model with its <strong><em>pull model</em></strong>. Through its provider network of <a href="https://pyth.network/publishers">first-party data sources</a>, Pyth addresses the two downstream trust assumptions of third-party data reliability. In Pyth’s pull model, data is provided directly by in-network exchanges, market makers, and DeFi protocols, like Jane Street, Binance, and Raydium. These entities are incentivized to behave honestly and to provide robust data to maintain a good reputation and avoid being banned by the protocol.</p><p>The remaining benefits hinge on offloading costs to the end consumer, where price feeds are updated on-demand instead of according to set time intervals. Hence, consumers initiate price updates, <em>pulling</em> the updates onchain in the same DeFi transaction (i.e., swapping assets, settling a perpetual swap, etc.). By offloading costs to users where updates are demand-based, Pyth redirects these costs and scales efficiently, as seen in its frequent updates on <a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">451 price feeds</a>.</p><h3>Core Interactions</h3><p>Pyth runs two instances of its protocol: one on the Solana mainnet and the other on the Pythnet appchain. Pyth on Solana only serves data to protocols on Solana; Pyth on Pythnet serves data to protocols on all other blockchains. Three core entities interact with each other to facilitate oracle updates on Pyth Network in both instances:</p><ul><li>Data Providers/Publishers (Jane Street, CTC, Binance, 0x, Raydium, etc.)</li><li>The Pyth Oracle Program (aggregation algorithm)</li><li>Data Consumers (applications/developers)</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2a3dc6fa67dda6f258b494ebc82ecc3d640c8156-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Data publishers are validators on Pythnet. Previously, the <a href="https://pythdataassociation.com/">Pyth Data Association</a> was responsible for delegating an adequate stake to the validators; however, with the launch of <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">governance</a>, this will now be managed by PYTH holders. As of writing, there are no proposals to change the dynamics of validator stake, which are currently all weighted equally. As the first-party suppliers of Pyth data, publishers are compensated by a small fee charged as a part of the entire DeFi transaction initiated by consumers.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client?tab=readme-ov-file#pyth-client">Pyth Oracle Program</a> is the aggregation algorithm that combines data submitted by publishers and produces an aggregate price and confidence interval for respective price feeds at the time of calculation. It’s also responsible for maintaining the price feeds, storing individual inputs from publishers, and performing additional computations like a moving average. Applications and developers are the consumers who request to update price feeds to read the information produced by the Oracle Program.</p><h3>Pyth on Solana</h3><p>Price feeds are represented as two Solana accounts: product and price accounts. Product accounts store metadata about the price feed, like ticker symbol, asset type, corresponding price account, etc. Price accounts contain the names of the authorized data providers, the prices and confidence intervals each provider submits, exponential moving averages, etc. Both accounts are maintained by the Oracle Program, which also contains a third account that essentially just lists product accounts. This setup enables applications to catalog the full list of price feeds offered by Pyth.</p><p>Price updates are submitted by publishers every 400 ms (the length of a time slot on Solana). Each update triggers frequent price and confidence interval aggregation updates to be used downstream in applications. (Because the Oracle Program stores the individual data values submitted by each publisher, publishers can be held accountable for poor performance or malicious actions.) Solana’s low costs enable Pyth —&nbsp;or any oracle — to run an efficient push model where developers simply pass the relevant price feed to their application, deserialize the data, and read/integrate the already published value.</p><p><em>Of note: By the end of Q2, Pyth plans to fully migrate its Solana push oracle to a new Solana pull oracle. Through <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/solana">development channels</a>, the Pyth team has noted that the Pyth pull oracle is live on devnet.</em></p><h3>Pythnet Appchain</h3><p>The Pythnet appchain is a Proof-of-Authority fork of Solana’s mainnet that acts as a computational base layer for processing and aggregating data provided by Pyth’s network of data publishers. The resulting price feeds on Pythnet are accessible to over <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/where-pyth-is-now-looking-towards-2024">50 blockchains</a> — excluding Solana, which has price feeds published directly to the blockchain. Because Pythnet is a fork of Solana, Pyth’s oracle framework on Solana and Pythnet are relatively similar with a few distinctions.</p><p>The push model on Solana described above (with accounts and the Oracle Program) is similar to Pythnet. However, Pythnet is not the destination chain and does not charge publishers for submitting prices. Hence, while data publishers push data to Pythnet to be aggregated and serialized into accounts via the Oracle Program, this data is then broadcast to other blockchains via <a href="https://wormhole.com/">Wormhole’s</a> cross-chain messaging protocol. Consumers then incur the costs on destination chains while initiating the data transfers with normal DeFi transactions that rely on oracle data — hence, pulling the data updates.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3c020b05699f58e3b97717294f52e4b099f6020b-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p><strong>Cross-Chain Messaging</strong></p><p>After data is published and aggregated on Pythnet, it is not immediately routed through Wormhole. Instead, Pyth routes its data through a message buffer and hashes it into a Merkle tree. Doing so ensures users can choose which updates are included in single transactions. It also keeps costs low for users and allows data updates to include arbitrary calculations. After every aggregation update, the aggregation program adds a message to the message buffer. For every slot, Pythnet validators read the messages and create a Merkle tree, sending a message containing the Merkle root of all the prices to the Wormhole contract on Pythnet.</p><p><a href="https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/guardian">Wormhole Guardians</a> (Wormhole nodes) then read the Merkle root message, create a Verifiable Action Approval (<a href="https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/vaa">VAA</a>), and broadcast price updates to the relevant blockchains. VAAs ensure that data is transferred reliably and securely. The VAAs include signatures from the Wormhole Guardians. These signatures confirm that the Guardians have witnessed and validated the information contained in the message, in this case, the Merkle root of the prices. The signed VAA is a verifiable and secure way to confirm that data transferred from Pythnet to the destination blockchain is accurate and has been authenticated by a trusted party (the Wormhole Guardians).</p><h3>Hermes</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/hermes">Hermes</a> is a web API that abstracts the update initiation process for developers. Without a service like Hermes, developers must manually compile an updated payload with the desired price feeds and use the Wormhole-verified Merkle root to get the corresponding data and Merkle proofs from Pythnet. Hermes introduces the ability for developers to simply query the web service to access oracle prices. Hermes enables data consumers to retrieve the latest prices pulling from REST or Websocket APIs.</p><ul><li><strong>REST (a subset of HTTP) API features</strong><ul><li>Best-suited for applications that require ad-hoc access to the latest data, need data at irregular intervals, or request data under certain conditions.</li><li>Simple to implement and use.</li><li>Streamlined client-server interaction, given each request is independent.</li><li>Scenarios: portfolio tracking, loan origination or repayment, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Websocket API features</strong><ul><li>Best-suited for applications requiring real-time, continuous data streaming.</li><li>Low maintenance: After the initial setup, data can be sent back and forth without the overhead of repeated HTTP headers, making it efficient for frequent data transmissions.</li><li>Given the persistent connection between the client and server, real-time updates enable instantaneous data updates.</li><li>Scenarios: arbitrage trading, yield-optimization tools, DEX trading, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Hermes is permissionless, enabling any third party to build a simplified access point to the Pyth Network. Because it is operationally difficult to run, the Pyth Data Association maintains a public version. However, other companies, like <a href="https://www.triton.one/pythnet/">Triton</a>, <a href="https://p2p.org/">P2P</a>, <a href="https://www.liquify.io/">Liquify</a>, and <a href="https://extrnode.com/solana">EXTR</a> also offer their own hosted versions of Hermes. A growing list of node providers offering Hermes can be found <a href="https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-instances-and-providers/hermes#node-providers">here</a>.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2a97d6843c16ce81a690e39add0121f00f44044c-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Pyth’s ecosystem token PYTH has a maximum supply of 10 billion PYTH. After its first unlock in May 2024, its distribution will reflect the following breakdown:</p><ul><li><strong>Community &amp; Launch (6%)</strong>: For initial launch and related activities and initiatives.</li><li><strong>Publisher Rewards (22%)</strong>: For Pyth’s network of data publishers. Used for rewards, grant programs, and as an incentive to encourage publishers to support new assets that may initially lack liquidity.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Growth (52%)</strong>: For contributors to the Pyth Network, including but not limited to developers, researchers, educators, and early publishers. The goal is to encourage initiatives and reward contributions that go beyond the founding team and core contributors.</li><li><strong>Protocol Development (10%)</strong>: For core contributors building tooling, products, and infrastructure (i.e., <a href="https://dourolabs.xyz/">Douro Labs</a>).</li><li><strong>Private Sales (10%)</strong>: For two funding rounds. Pyth has not disclosed the price per PYTH sold nor its valuation for either of the rounds. In <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/expanding-the-pyth-community-strategic-capital-and-new-builders">December 2023</a>, Pyth published an update about an earlier strategic round that included notable investors, such as Castle Island Ventures, Wintermute Ventures, Borderless Capital, CMT Digital, Bodhi Ventures, Distributed Global, Multicoin Capital, and Delphi Digital.</li></ul><h3>Governance</h3><p>The <a href="https://messari.io/project/pyth-network">PYTH</a> token is an <a href="https://spl.solana.com/token">SPL</a> token on Solana (equivalent to an <a href="https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20">ERC-20</a> on Ethereum). The core utility of PYTH is <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">governance</a>. PYTH holders can guide protocol development by staking the asset and voting on Pyth Improvement Proposals (PIPs). As of writing, the only proposals voted on or being voted on include the Pythian Council elections and the ratification of the <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/governance/blob/309c716599617971c6abb18f2097412d977b954f/docs/constitution/pyth-dao-constitution.md">Pyth DAO Constitution</a>. Typical subject matters that governance encompasses and can modify include:</p><ul><li>Onchain software updates</li><li>Reward structures for data providers</li><li>Creating rules for permissioning publishers</li><li>Size, denomination, and existence of oracle update fees</li><li>Adding new price feeds and determining who supports them</li></ul><p>Pyth DAO consists of the Pythian Council and the Price Feed Council. Both councils hold elections every six months to rotate members of the councils. Additionally, members who participate less than one-third of the time are excluded from reelection. This system ensures active members play a part in the process and that members stay aligned with Pyth’s goals. Both councils are responsible for the voting and implementation of certain Operational PIPs.</p><ul><li><strong>Pythian Council</strong><ul><li>Eight members and the Operations Wallet holder are signers of the Pythian 7-of-9 multi-sig wallet.</li><li>Four members are replaced every election.</li><li>Can be delegated the power to vote on Operational PIPs that involve updates to the oracle program, verification mechanism, adjusting oracle update fees and denominations, and the management of PGAS (the gas token on Pythnet that is allocated/delegated to validators).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Price Feed Council</strong><ul><li>Seven members and the Operations Wallet holder are signers of the Price Feed 5-of-8 multi-sig wallet.</li><li>Three members are replaced every election.</li><li>Can be delegated the power to vote on Operational PIPs that involve managing the set of offered price feeds, the selection of publishers, and price feed requirements (i.e., minimum and maximum publishers per feed).</li></ul></li></ul><p>After discussions on Pyth’s forum on <a href="https://discord.gg/nE79EaQA">Discord</a>, PYTH holders can vote on proposals when they reach the “Voting Phase” via the governance portal on <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">Realms</a>, which currently <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH/params">requires</a> proposers to hold 25 million PYTH to create a proposal.</p><p>Pyth DAO has two types of PIPs: Constitutional and Operational. Constitutional PIPs involve protocol updates, determining structure, and guiding the administration of the Pyth DAO. They require greater than 67% support for implementation. Operational PIPs involve elections and the management of the treasury, Pythian Council, and Price Feed Council. Voting on these PIPs can be delegated to Council members and require greater than 50% support for implementation.</p><h2>Pyth Usage</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e7f672835cb71eab6d6b7efa34c269c345d57967-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Pyth is one of the most used protocols on Solana. Its oracle transactions accounted for an average of 20% of all transactions on Solana during February 2024. In this same time period, Pyth data providers paid $225,000 in fees on Solana. Pyth oracles secure 95% of the value on the blockchain. Pyth also secures over 90% of the value on 9 other blockchains and over 50% on 16 others, as of <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/where-pyth-is-now-looking-towards-2024">January 2024</a>.</p><h3>Notable Users</h3><p>Pyth has become one of the most widely used oracle protocols across an array of blockchains, thanks to its ability to scale feeds on Pythnet. Instead of adding new feeds to destination chains, it simply adds new feeds to Pythnet, which can be used by Pyth’s oracle contract on each destination chain it supports. Hence, Pyth can simply build an oracle contract for whatever chain it plans to expand to. With its growing support for many blockchains, various projects have adopted Pyth’s oracle network. A couple of notable projects are listed below.</p><p><strong>Synthetix</strong></p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/synthetix-q4-2023-brief">Synthetix</a> is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that enables the creation of synthetic assets, known as Synths, which track the value of crypto and real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and stocks. Synthetix allows users to gain exposure to various assets without actually holding them, thereby broadening investment opportunities and enhancing liquidity in the crypto market. A crucial component of Synthetix's functionality is its <a href="https://docs.synthetix.io/synthetix-protocol/the-synthetix-protocol/oracles">integration</a> with Pyth Network oracles. These oracles provide high-fidelity, real-time price feeds that are essential for maintaining the accuracy of the Synths' values.</p><p><strong>Helium</strong></p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/helium-laying-the-foundation-for-a-telecom-network-deployment-platform">Helium</a> is a decentralized wireless Internet of Things (IoT) network. It incorporates token-economic incentives encouraging network participants to deploy wireless devices that provide mobile network coverage. Helium <a href="https://docs.helium.com/oracles/price-oracles">utilizes</a> Pyth Network oracles to provide precise onchain market prices for Helium's native token, HNT. These values are essential for a range of network activities, including the conversion of burned HNT into Data Credits (DC) and accurately measuring treasury allocations. Though Helium is not DeFi, using Pyth oracles in Helium’s decentralized connectivity platform highlights the importance of precise data in managing the economics of even <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-depin-2023">DePIN</a> protocols.</p><p><strong>Eclipse</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.eclipse.xyz/">Eclipse</a> recently <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281566/eclipse-labs-raises-50-million-in-series-a-funding-ahead-of-expected-q2-mainnet">raised $50 million</a> in a Series A round to launch the first Layer-2 blockchain that will use the SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) for execution and Celestia for data availability, all while deriving security from Ethereum as a settlement layer. The launch of Eclipse should attract liquidity from Ethereum users and route them to Solana-based decentralized applications across the Layer-2. As Solana’s leading oracle, Pyth will support many of the applications expanding to and launching on Eclipse.</p><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/817677a4dcd2f4a2efeb65915724552cedb7ada8-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>The oracle landscape is a competitive sector that has been dominated by Chainlink. Though <a href="https://messari.io/report/web3-oracles-on-chronicle-protocol">Chronicle Protocol</a> created the first onchain oracle in 2017 for MakerDAO, it did not launch a public oracle network until late 2023. It currently only offers feeds on two blockchains, though it plans to expand. Chainlink captured market share in the developing years of DeFi, launching a variety of oracle-based products that serve a broad spectrum of markets. As of writing, only three protocols <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secure more value</a> than Pyth Network: Chainlink, Chronicle, and WINkLink — these top four protocols account for 90–95% of the TVS among oracles. That said, Pyth secures value on the largest number of blockchains. Chainlink is Pyth’s largest competitor in both the diversity of blockchains covered and value secured.</p><h3>Chainlink</h3><p>Critics have referred to Chainlink as a “<a href="https://blockworks.co/news/chronicle-protocol-oracle-black-box-problem">black box</a>” given the opaqueness of where oracle nodes source their data. Sources are not identified onchain nor on the websites of Chainlink oracle nodes. In contrast, each data point on Pyth Network can be traced back to the public keys of individual publishers by copying the transaction hash from Pyth’s <a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">Price Feed web page</a> to any Solana <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/">block explorer</a>. While data on Chainlink can also be traced back to Chainlink oracle nodes, Pyth data providers are first-party sources. Unlike Chainlink’s data, Pyth’s published data was sourced internally from their operations as an exchange, trading firm, market maker, etc. However, provider public keys are not publicly linked with their identity, which adds a layer of trust in how Pyth (which permissioned publishers originally) manages its publisher network.</p><p>While Pyth is singularly focused on traditional finance and crypto price feeds, Chainlink has several offerings. These include an interoperability protocol (<a href="https://chain.link/cross-chain">CCIP</a>), <a href="https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve">Proof of Reserve</a> feeds, and developer tooling (<a href="https://chain.link/vrf">VRFs</a>, <a href="https://chain.link/functions">API functions</a>, and <a href="https://chain.link/automation">automation services</a>), in addition to its <a href="https://chain.link/data-feeds">market data</a> feeds. Hence, Pyth’s primary product challenges Chainlink’s leading market data feed product — though Pyth also offers a random number generator through <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/secure-random-numbers-for-blockchains">Pyth Entropy</a>. The following is a comparison of the aspects of Pyth’s and Chainlink’s market data feeds:</p><p><strong>Data source</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pyth</strong><ul><li>Pyth aggregates data directly from primary sources and updates price feeds on the Pythnet appchain and Solana every 400 ms.</li><li>Outside of Solana, other chains must initiate a price update for it to be published to the respective chain, implying that the staleness of data is between 400 ms and the next on-demand update.</li><li>There’s a potential conflict of interest for data publishers (that also trade) to publish honest data points that may be disadvantageous to particular trades. Assuming most publishers are honest, seek to maintain a high reputation, and do not coordinate updates, Pyth’s aggregation algorithm should mitigate this risk by applying a low weight to outlier data points.</li><li>Sourcing data directly from primary sources enables the quick addition of price feeds for newly created pairs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chainlink</strong><ul><li>Chainlink aggregates data from secondary sources (data aggregators) and publishes prices feed updates onchain where the frequency depends on the blockchain.</li><li>Staleness of a data point is dependent on secondary source updates and oracle network aggregation.</li><li>Though a primary source may support a particular trading pair, price feed availability depends on secondary aggregators also implementing coverage of that data point. This could add friction in adding new feeds, though this is not an issue with significant trading pairs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Pull v. Push Model</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pyth</strong><ul><li>Pyth on Solana uses a push model, publishing updates every 400 ms.</li><li>Pyth on Pythnet uses a pull model, where users initiate an update on the destination chain, published updates on Pythnet are routed through Wormhole, and updates are published to the requesting chain. The users incur costs in this model.</li><li>Because all market price feeds (outside Solana) are on Pythnet, Pyth offers increased scalability that reduces the costs and time to integrate feeds directly on supported/new chains. However, Pyth’s scalability introduces latency and an added layer of trust/reliance on Wormhole.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chainlink</strong><ul><li>Chainlink’s primary market feeds use a push model, publishing updates often at the block times of destination chains. This can be costly to the oracle nodes and can cause update transactions to fail in high-volatility environments (though rare).</li><li>Adding price feeds to new and existing chains is more costly, as new price feeds must be implemented for each supported network.</li><li>Not reliant on an additional relayer, and does not add trust between Chainlink’s oracle network and destination blockchains.</li><li>Chainlink also offers a pull model in its <a href="https://data.chain.link/streams">Data Streams</a> product.</li><li>Similar data process to push model, except data is delivered to Chainlink’s offchain Data Engine, which delivers price updates when data is requested onchain.</li><li>Currently, Data Streams are only on Arbitrum and maintain eight price feeds.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Usage</strong></p><ul><li>Pyth <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $5.5 billion on 162 protocols across <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a>.</li><li>Chainlink <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $38.7 billion on 371 protocols across <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">19 blockchains</a>.</li></ul><p>Both systems offer advantages and disadvantages in market data feeds. Pyth’s model is better equipped to scale the number of price feeds and maintain high update frequency. However, Pyth’s ability to maintain high-fidelity data depends on the assumption that the costs of reputation and collusion outweigh any profitable, malicious actions that could benefit publishers. And its network stability relies on Wormhole's uptime. Conversely, Chainlink’s model requires less trust in original data sources and between the oracle network and supported blockchains, given it pulls from secondary aggregation sources and publishes directly to destination chains. However, scaling data feeds and reaching a wider breadth of blockchains is more costly. Regardless, as crypto continues to grow, new protocols will have many options and tradeoffs/risks to consider in implementing different oracle price feeds.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Pyth Network is a novel protocol that has changed the oracle landscape. It fosters a network of first-party data publishers and implements a pull-based oracle that offloads fees to oracle users. With this design, Pyth cuts costs for the oracle network, increases price update frequency, and secures direct market data based directly on primary data sources. Since launching, Pyth has grown to serve the largest number of blockchains and accounts for the fourth-largest amount of total value secured ($5.5 billion as of March 2024). As it grows its publisher network, Pyth is well-positioned to achieve its mission of making all of the world’s financial market data available to Web3.</p><p>——</p></div>

Polkadot was built using the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk">Polkadot SDK</a>, a blockchain development framework. Furthermore, Polkadot’s base layer is known as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain">Relay Chain</a>, which employs a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)</a> consensus mechanism, and its state machine is compiled to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a>.</p><p><br />Polkadot's governance transitioned to the <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> model on June 15, 2023, marking a significant evolution from its original <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#:~:text=Polkadot%20uses%20a%20sophisticated%20governance,can%20always%20command%20the%20network.">Gov V1</a> framework. This new model has enhanced the platform's governance by introducing mechanisms that have led to a higher frequency of referenda, an increase in Treasury activities, and a greater level of decentralization. This report will delve into the details of Polkadot’s governance, providing a comprehensive comparison between the original Gov V1 and the OpenGov model. It will also analyze the impact of these governance changes on the network.</p><p></p><h2>Polkadot Governance V1</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>The initial governance framework of Polkadot, <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#:~:text=Polkadot%20uses%20a%20sophisticated%20governance,can%20always%20command%20the%20network.">Governance V1</a>, centered around three core bodies: the Council, the Technical Committee, and the Referendum Chamber. These groups collectively supported the network's finances, technology, and other miscellaneous developments. This structure facilitated a balanced approach to decision-making and operations, engaging various stakeholders in the governance process.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><p>The roles of Gov V1 stakeholders were as follows:</p><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#council"><strong>Council</strong></a>: Composed of 13 members, the Council's responsibilities included managing proposals, canceling referenda, and electing the Technical Committee. </li><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee"><strong>Technical Committee</strong></a>: Formed by key Polkadot developers and selected by the Council, the Technical Committee was tasked with blocking harmful proposals and expediting necessary fixes and updates. </li><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee"><strong>Referendum Chamber</strong></a>: This chamber included all DOT token-holders engaged in the governance process by staking, endorsing, or delegating their tokens to gain voting rights. </li></ul><p></p><p>Funding for the Polkadot ecosystem was managed through the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury">Treasury</a> in Gov V1. The Treasury accumulated resources from block rewards and transaction fees. Spending proposals required Council approval and a waiting period of 28 days. </p><h3>Process</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2d087b0bc2d520daae1d2a89881670f526bb08a7-6400x3572.png?w=800" /><p>The Polkadot Gov V1 governance process was structured to engage token holders actively in the network's evolution. The process is outlined as follows:<br /></p><ol><li><strong>Proposal Submission and Endorsement</strong>: Any party could initiate proposals. These were then queued and required endorsements to progress. The most supported proposal was moved forward for voting.</li><li><strong>Referendum and Voting</strong>: The voting cycle alternated between public proposals and those put forward by the Council, incorporating emergency fast-tracks and token-boosted delegated voting.</li><li><strong>Council and Treasury Involvement</strong>: The Council played a key role in managing Treasury funds, proposing, and evaluating proposals.</li><li><strong>Adaptive Quorum Biasing</strong>: Voting thresholds were adjusted dynamically based on turnout and the source of proposals.</li><li><strong>Proposal Enactment</strong>: Passed referenda, subject to a waiting period, alternated between public and council proposals.</li></ol><p></p><h2>Polkadot OpenGov</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>The Polkadot ecosystem <a href="https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/polkadot-hands-decision-making-powers-to-its-community-with-opengov-launch">rolled out</a> <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> on June 15, 2023. This model places the community at the center of decision-making processes and eliminates any control from Parity Technologies and Web3 Foundation.</p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polkadot">Referenda</a> in the OpenGov system undergo a structured life cycle for enactment, including the Lead-in Period for proposal submission, the Decision Period for voting and approval, and the Enactment Period for execution. OpenGov allows multiple referenda to run concurrently, allowing for the faster passage of motions.</p><p>In the OpenGov framework, the traditional roles of the Council and Technical Committee have evolved into the <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polkadot">Fellowship</a>, which provides deep technical expertise without special voting powers. Functioning as a developer DAO, it champions decentralization through advocating community-based voting along with rigorous checks and balances. Membership to the Fellowship is open to all who qualify, marking a departure from the exclusive council system. This model also commits to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship">paying developers</a> for their contributions to Polkadot. Furthermore, it introduces a novel delegation mechanism, empowering users to allocate their voting power by conviction and token commitment.</p><p></p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><p>The OpenGov stakeholders’ roles are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>DOT Tokenholders</strong>: DOT tokenholders are at the heart of the OpenGov system and carry the primary responsibility for governance decisions. This includes voting on proposals, delegating voting rights, and actively participating in shaping the network's future. The direct democracy model empowers every tokenholder to have a say in the governance process, democratizing the decision-making and making the system more reflective of the community's collective will.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows"><strong>Polkadot Technical Fellowship</strong></a>: As the new technical advisory body, the Fellowship plays a crucial role in guiding the technical direction of the Polkadot network. They are responsible for reviewing technical proposals and ensuring that changes and updates to the network are sound, secure, and aligned with Polkadot's long-term vision.</li></ul><p>This evolution in governance roles under OpenGov illustrates a strategic move towards a more participatory and technically robust decision-making process, aligning closely with the ethos of decentralized and democratic blockchain governance.</p><h3>Process</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/c8f086f84fc678a83e7b41db2760cd9967cdcccb-6432x3604.png?w=800" /><p>OpenGov introduces a nuanced and dynamic system for proposal submission, evaluation, and enactment:</p><p><strong>1. Proposal Submission and Evaluation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Public Initiation: In OpenGov, all proposals originate from the public, emphasizing community-driven governance.</li><li>Lead-in Period: After submission, proposals enter a lead-in period, a preparatory phase that ensures proposals are thoroughly considered before moving forward.</li><li>Assignment to Tracks: Proposals are categorized into one of fifteen Tracks based on their nature and requirements, each with a distinct Origin determining the referendum's duration and voting capacity.<strong>Tracks and Origins</strong>:</li><li>Diverse Tracks for Varied Proposals: Tracks like Small Tipper or Big Spender categorize Treasury proposals by funding amount, ensuring appropriate handling.</li><li>Expedited Processing: The Polkadot Technical Fellowship can fast-track proposals via a Whitelist Caller origin, streamlining the review and voting processes.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Voting and Approval Process</strong>:</p><ul><li>Simultaneous Voting Across Tracks: OpenGov permits concurrent voting on proposals across different tracks, adhering to capacity limits to ensure manageable decision-making.</li><li>Multi-Role Delegations: Voters can delegate their voting power to experts in specific tracks, optimizing governance participation without requiring constant engagement from all tokenholders.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Mechanisms for Control and Correction</strong>:</p><ul><li>Cancellation and Blacklisting: OpenGov allows the community to cancel ongoing referenda or blacklist proposals, preventing them from re-entering the queue. This feature is essential for managing malicious or spam proposals.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Detailed Governance Stages</strong>:</p><ul><li>Creation and Lead-in: Proposals must satisfy origin-specific criteria, including a deposit to manage spam and capacity.</li><li>Decision Period: Proposals advance to voting, where they must meet predefined approval and support criteria to pass.</li><li>Enactment Period: Successful proposals undergo an enactment period before the changes are implemented, allowing the network to prepare for the transition.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Additional Governance Elements</strong>:</p><ul><li>Origin and Track Dynamics: Each proposal's path is determined by its Origin and Track, with specific parameters for decision-making and enactment tailored to its impact.</li><li>Multiplier Feature: Tokenholders can amplify their voting power through token locking, with the conviction multiplier increasing based on the lock period.</li><li>Approval and Support Mechanisms: Proposals require meeting approval and support thresholds within a confirmation period to progress, ensuring broad consensus for enactment.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Strategic Voting and Proposal Management</strong>:</p><ul><li>Approval and Support Thresholds: A sophisticated system evaluates proposal viability through approval and support metrics, adjusting to ensure proposals have substantial backing.</li><li>Dynamic Confirmation Period: The confirmation period's flexibility allows for re-evaluating proposals based on shifting voter sentiment, maintaining governance integrity</li></ul><p>Polkadot's OpenGov system introduces a governance model that balances community input, expert evaluation, and strategic decision-making. Through its stages, multi-tiered voting system, and mechanisms for correction and control, OpenGov empowers the Polkadot community to actively shape the network's evolution in a structured and effective manner.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/20bc2470696e15dba1934b984fb754e0322b7cff-6400x3572.png?w=800" /><h2>Data</h2><p>This data is sourced from the Parity Data Team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/dotlake_xyz">DotLake</a> platform, a data lake containing offchain and onchain data on the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/9b33e69b0fdf40253a9d884b8be42214ac7d6bc0-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Following the transition to OpenGov, a significant increase in platform engagement has been observed. The average number of votes has risen by 1,981% compared to Gov V1. This trend extends to referenda, which have seen a 1,008% increase in participation after the transition. Notably, 40% of referenda under OpenGov were not approved, in contrast to a 9% rejection rate under Gov V1. This indicates a shift towards a wider range of voting behaviors and outcomes, suggesting that OpenGov fosters a more diverse and dynamic governance environment than its predecessor.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/36717088dc409dda25283bbd8474d652116bcec5-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Since the introduction of OpenGov, the number of Treasury proposal submissions has significantly exceeded those made through Gov V1. Gov V1 recorded 83 proposals before OpenGov’s implementation, while OpenGov received 401 proposals (+405%). This transition resulted in an average monthly increase of 126% in proposals submitted to OpenGov, which now represents 80% of all treasury proposals. OpenGov proposals peaked in November 2023 with 92.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/5527d7e9a504253e5ddfa39f262c922b63cce37d-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Between June 2023 and January 2024, the counts of direct and delegated voters in the Polkadot governance system were closely matched, with 66,602 direct voters and 65,508 delegated voters recorded. Initially, direct voting was the more popular method following the launch of OpenGov, but over time, the trend shifted towards an increasing preference for delegated voting. December 2023 experienced the highest voter turnout in the latter half of the year, which could be attributed to year-end voting activities. This trend towards delegated voting indicates a clear preference that is expected to maintain or increase governance participation over time.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b1a5451ed20ed6160f2fc62e6af7e42039b6d51b-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Outflows from the Polkadot Treasury have seen a steady increase. The primary outflows are from <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#bounties">bounties</a> and proposals. Both bounties and proposals saw increases in the second half of 2023, with bounties increasing 18% and proposals increasing 116%.<br /></p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Polkadot's governance underwent a significant evolution with the transition to OpenGov in June 2023. The shift aimed to enhance community involvement through new mechanisms like replacing the Council and Technical Committee with the Fellowship and introducing a more dynamic proposal system. Thus far, OpenGov has accomplished its mission with referenda and votes each up over 1,000% through six months, treasury proposals up over 405%, and both direct and delegated voters increasing.</p><p>Overall, this new governance model has boosted platform engagement and governance participation. These changes underscore Polkadot's commitment to fostering a participatory and responsive ecosystem.</p></div>

This set of enhancements covers multiple areas including protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance.</p><p>The core <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-2-0-the-value-layer-of-the-internet">vision</a> of Polygon 2.0 is to build an aggregated blockchain network that enables unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. This upgrade aims to address the inherent scaling challenges faced by Web3, where the addition of new chains often results in fragmented liquidity and an underwhelming user experience.</p><h2><strong>Aggregation Layer (AggLayer)</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/bdb7cbf18259beb1deabd838fc6a4ad38bee069c-602x300.png?w=800" /><p>In January 2024, Polygon Labs released <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis">information</a> about the AggLayer within the Polygon ecosystem, addressing challenges in blockchain architectures by unifying the liquidity and state of ZK-secured chains. The AggLayer enables "near-instant atomic cross-chain transactions" and aims to unify liquidity across its ecosystem. Developers can connect any EVM L1 or L2 to the AggLayer. This allows the chains to "maintain full sovereignty" while enabling them to access a larger pool of liquidity, aggregated users, and dApps. The first version of AggLayer is scheduled for release in February 2024.

The tokenized and gaming features leveraged by The Sandbox are listed below.</p><ul><li>SAND — an ERC-20 token and digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation</li><li>LAND — digital ownable land within The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>ESTATE — a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot</li><li>ASSET — assets created using the VoxEdit application that are converted to ERC-1155 tokens when uploaded to The Sandbox marketplace</li><li>AVATARS — ERC-721 tokens that are playable characters within The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>CATALYST — tokens burnt to define an ASSETs tier/scarcity</li><li>Game Maker — a <a href="https://gamemaker.sandbox.game/#/en/a">toolbox</a> that enables users to create 3D games and experiences in The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>VoxEdit — software used to create and animate equipment and other types of gaming assets</li><li>Game Client — enables players to play experiences created with the Game Maker</li></ul><p>The Sandbox provides Roblox-esque gameplay with digital ownership and more robust in-game economics due to the tradeable nature of the SAND token and the other assets within the Sandbox virtual world.</p><p>Sandbox offers a variety of in-game NFTs as well as user-generated NFTs. The VoxEdit NFT builder is used for creating 3D objects (ASSETs) such as characters, equipment, wearables, and art.</p><p>The Sandbox was initially launched as a <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/games/the-sandbox/">2D mobile game in 2012</a> by the software development company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pixowl/">Pixowl</a>. Pixowl was founded in 2011 by Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget. The mobile game iteration of Sandbox accumulated more than <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/19/the-sandbox-raises-2-million-more-to-build-out-blockchain-based-game-world/">40 million downloads</a> by April 2018. In May 2018, The Sandbox <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/gamesposts/animoca-brands-acquires-pixowl-world-building-developer-of-the-sandbox/">rebranded</a> as a 3D metaverse game and blockchain-focused development began. In August 2018, Pixowl and The Sandbox were <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/gamesposts/animoca-brands-acquires-pixowl-world-building-developer-of-the-sandbox/">acquired by Animoca Brands</a>, a gaming-focused software development company and VC Fund.</p><p><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vAe4zvY">Discord</a></p><h2>Network Overview</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e7bea12c089753af07a5179e25e542492ae4560e-7296x4060.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2c1d2efd0ee4cbc0e98afc20ffddc819b1c9c3f8-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>SAND staking is conducted on the Polygon network and involves two staking pools: one for LAND owners and one for everyone else. LAND owners can stake up to 2,000 SAND per LAND asset in this pool. In the other pool, any SAND holder can stake their SAND, though LAND owners receive a multiplier based on the number of LANDs they own.</p><p>Daily average SAND staked was down 8% QoQ, from 110.2 million to 101.7 million. By the end of Q4, 23.8 million SAND was staked in the LAND pool, and 74.8 million SAND was staked in the non-LAND owners pool. The amount of SAND staked by LAND owners decreased by 7% QoQ, but the amount of SAND staked in the non-LAND owners pool actually increased by 1% QoQ. Additionally, the percentage of circulating supply of SAND staked fell by 11% QoQ from 5.5% to 4.9%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0a2dcb0601f7dca8eb1f65d0fe77d345eac197b9-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The decrease in SAND staked throughout 2023 also coincided with lower SAND staking rewards. In Q4 of last year, 5.6 million SAND was distributed as staking rewards. In Q4, this number fell by 82% to 1 million SAND. However, over the same time period, the daily average amount of SAND staked only fell by 9% from 112.2 million. This dynamic suggests that The Sandbox may have been overcompensating stakers earlier in the year.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/78c7ede648109c0af51cc6ffc68144195dd0f06a-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Non-LAND minting activity bounced back in Q4, totaling 30,194 mints (up 233% QoQ) for the entire quarter. This also lead to a YoY increase of 246%. Popular non-LAND mints in Q4 included Avatars from the <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk?utm_source=thesandboxtwitter&amp;utm_campaign=captainlaserhawk&amp;utm_medium=_5651876&amp;gsid=1eeb57c8344c64f69c2736f1f18fd449&amp;gsc=1">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a>, <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/extraordinary-attorney-woo/en/">Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>, and <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/big-poppa-collection/en/">THE NOTORIOUS B.I.G. Big Poppa</a> collections. As for LAND items, they experienced a downtrend in Q4. After an impressive 3,719 LAND mints in Q3, LAND mints fell by 59% QoQ to 1,536 in Q4.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/23d6939113317faa0b33d5404e8852c5be6406dc-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Activity on The Sandbox is conducted through digital real estate called LAND NFTs. Content creators can host metaverse experiences on plots of LAND. As such, LAND is valued highly amongst all The Sandbox NFTs. While non-LAND NFTs are valued lower, they are still necessary for various types of activities in The Sandbox metaverse (e.g., CATALYSTS to create ASSETS and give them attributes).</p><p>With a difference in general monetary value, LAND is harder to acquire (at a 0.33 ETH floor on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox/analytics">OpenSea</a> as of December 31), lowering the buyer pool. Non-LAND assets are priced lower (at a 0.0001 ETH floor on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-sandbox-assets/activity?search[sortAscending]=true&amp;search[sortBy]=UNIT_PRICE&amp;search[toggles][0]=BUY_NOW">OpenSea</a> as of December 31), drawing a larger pool of buyers. These differences were accentuated by poor NFT market conditions in 2023, potentially contributing to the number of active LAND buyers falling (down 20% QoQ) and to active non-LAND buyers increasing (up 73% QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/80d53cdb52d7402410f4922dd40b771d0da62ce8-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The secondary sale volume measures the USD amounts for The Sandbox assets that were sold on secondary exchanges like OpenSea and LooksRare.</p><p>Daily average secondary volume for LAND increased by 11% QoQ, from $19,100 to $21,300. The daily average for secondary sales of LAND also increased by 19% QoQ, from 30 to 35. As such, the remaining active buyers demonstrated a willingness to spend larger amounts of money on LAND, even though the number of active LAND buyers decreased in Q4.</p><p>Alongside the number of active buyers for non-LAND items increasing in Q4, the daily average secondary volume for non-LAND items increased by 78% from $1,900 to $3,400. Furthermore, the daily average for sales also increased by 173% QoQ from 64 to 176.</p><h2>Financial Overview</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/53243d5d4b01c99b3aafeeca027a0ba0b73d0310-7296x4060.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d73dc92e6c11f01a803a5824475f4a690c9cdaa7-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Q4 was a strong quarter for SAND’s price performance, as its circulating market cap increased by 89% QoQ from $649.9 million to $1.2 billion. This increase was largely attributable to the price increase of SAND, up 86% QoQ from $0.31 to $0.58. Additionally, SAND outperformed the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts">total market cap</a> of all cryptocurrencies, which gained 54% in Q4. Comparatively, SAND also outperformed gaming peer MANA (up 68% QoQ), but it slightly underperformed AXS (up 92% QoQ) and GALA (up 98% QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/8ac00ffbcb8b85c6d0c4575977458bc05f5180b5-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The total primary sale volume measures the USD amounts for which assets from The Sandbox were sold. The Sandbox company retains the earnings from primary sales. The Sandbox conducts five different types of primary sales: public non-LAND, public LAND, private LAND, private ESTATE, and private Auction.</p><p>In total, primary sales volume was down 47% QoQ, decreasing from $1.38 million to $739,000. In nominal terms, primary LAND sales volume fell the most, decreasing by $409,000 QoQ (down 55% QoQ). In percentage terms, Auction volume fell the most, decreasing by 69% QoQ (down $24,000 QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/bf26cbdf9176bcba5a66c47a1d74100d7b3ffc0e-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The Sandbox’s breakdown of primary sales volume was consistently changing throughout 2023. In Q1, the biggest driver of primary sales volume was private LAND sales. By Q4, however, public LAND sales had become the largest driver, representing 44% of all primary sales volume. Categories that saw an increase in share of primary sales volume in Q4 included non-LAND sales (up 43% QoQ to 29%) and private LAND sales (up 19% QoQ to 11%). Categories that saw a decrease included Auction sales (down 43% QoQ to 1%), public LAND sales (down 17% QoQ to 44%), and Estate sales (down 4% to 14%).</p><p>Total revenue is the sum of the total primary sale volume and total royalty revenue. Royalty Revenue for an individual secondary sale varies from 0 to 5%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f9a934d2c43c11c3529db5a9b65696dc661e44cb-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Total revenue was down 42% QoQ, from $1.4 million in Q3 to $839,000 in Q4. This drop was primarily due to the decrease in primary sales volume, as that is the largest driver of revenue for The Sandbox. Despite the fall in revenue, royalty revenue picked up in Q4. Royalty revenue from LAND sales increased from $51,000 to $95,000, an 87% QoQ increase. Non-LAND royalty revenue was down slightly, down 12% QoQ from $6,000 to $5,000.</p><h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2><p>Q4’23 marked another busy quarter for The Sandbox, highlighted by various events, partnerships, integrations, and updates.
