<div> 手机、闹钟、笔记、替代品、影响

总结：<br /><br />文章讨论了作者如何通过更换闹钟和笔记方式来改善生活习惯，摆脱手机带来的干扰，提高专注力和生产力。作者选择了Braun闹钟和Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W作为替代品，取得了显著效果，更加专注于计划和思考，提升了日常工作效率。这种改变让作者更加满意，建议读者尝试。 <div>
<h2 id="the-problem--why">The Problem / Why</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://youtu.be/K2tGt2XWd9Q?si=h-xh-X90JWxwF1KU&amp;t=2229">asked</a> about which practices supported Chris Williamson into his current position, Chris mentioned that sleeping with his phone outside of the bedroom and getting a plain alarm clock was his number one change.</p>

<p>I found that statement interesting, especially because I had grown a habit of seeing the occasional video before sleep and being engaged with random distractions shortly after waking up.</p>

<p>Overriding these behaviors required a good amount of self discipline and willpower to be overridden, and fundamentally deviated my focus from what I would want to accomplish on a given day, from the book I had been putting off, or to simply wind down.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-alarm-and-note-taking">Alternative Alarm and Note Taking</h2>

<p>Even though my phone sponsored my distractions, it was also my trusty alarm and favorite way to write down notes and reflections that crossed my mind outside my work desk. So to make the leap of keeping my mobile phone at the bedroom door, I would need to replace the alarm clock, and find a new way to write down my notes.</p>

<h3 id="alarm">Alarm</h3>

<p>This seems like an easy step, but it turns out the selection of alarms is immense, and many of them either do too much, or don’t tick all the boxes.</p>

<p>Essentially, I needed a trustworthy, low maintenance, alarm with essential functionalities that would not flood my dark bedroom with blue light when I wanted to check the time during night.</p>

<p>I essentially browsed through:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.lumie.com/">Lumie alarms</a>: had the enticing proposition of science-backed approach of waking up via warm light or soothing sounds, but didn’t have the basic functionality of having recurrent alarms on the models I was interested in, and required a mains connection, meaning that upon a power outage it could only support itself for a limited amount of time.</li>
  <li>White brand alarm clocks: the selection is immense on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=alarm+clock">Amazon</a>, and even though they come in at relatively cheap prices, some require a mains connection, or have short battery life, or need to be recharged every so often, or do too much (like having a bluetooth connection) or use noisy clock dials.</li>
</ul>

<p>After several searches, I’ve stumbled upon Braun alarm clocks. These have been around for decades, and I recalled that Steve Jobs was inspired more than once by products made by Braun when creating his Apple products, due to Braun’s thoughtful approach on how everyday products were designed.</p>

<p>I’ve settled with the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Braun-Digital-Compact-Negative-Crescendo/dp/B083KMCHRH">Braun BC08B</a>. No moving parts, a single AAA battery apparently lasts more than half a year, small, simple, easy to operate, and the beeping sound is not brain drilling. The one aspect I am not fully satisfied is its screen light, which when activated is too strong on a dark bedroom (my mobile phone far excels in this aspect, due to its less intrusive always on black and white display).</p>

         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="note-taking">Note Taking</h3>

<p>These were the alternatives I found for writing down notes, and jotting down diagrams (as a plus):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Notebook:
    <ul>
      <li>Pros: Easy to use, low cost, no distractions, low maintenance (no battery to recharge, software updates, etc)</li>
      <li>Cons: My handwriting is appalling and my character output is much lower when compared to typing; extra step needed to transfer it a digital means; harder to organize</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>E-Ink Devices:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://remarkable.com/">Remarkable 2</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: well thought out, clean and focus driven, great writing experience; allows for handwriting to text conversion</li>
          <li>Cons: Able to connect to a Google Drive for free, but works storage rather than syncing, so it is cumbersome to iterate on notes and diagrams between it and other devices</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://supernote.com/">Supernote</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: clean and focus driven, great writing experience; allows for handwriting to text conversion; open <a href="https://trello.com/b/l0COP24j/supernote-a5-x-a6-x-nomad-software-roadmap-2024">roadmap</a> and ideology; easy repair and upgrade</li>
          <li>Cons: As with Remarkable, it does not provide real file syncing, but file copy to Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B">Kindle Scribe</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: Writing experience seems to be good and on-device handwriting recognition to convert notes into actual text</li>
          <li>Cons: No Google Play apps, meaning that Google Keep and Google Docs would not be available, and no Google Drive sync; the device caters more to readers, rather than writers in my opinion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air3-ePaper/dp/B0CP3CGG8P">Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: it can use Google Keep and Google Docs apps, since can do almost everything a normal Android table can, but since it uses a e-ink screen and has limited processing capabilities, it does not make a good fit for browsing the web or seeing videos (which is actually a good thing); the default experience and drawing app are bloated offer too many distractions (<a href="http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox.html">see here how to debloat it</a>); allows for handwriting to text conversion within Onyx drawing app</li>
          <li>Cons: noticeable lag when writing; if not using Onyx’s cloud, it requires extra steps to export and share a diagram / drawing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>: even though this device is amazing, it made it too easy to access the same distractions I was trying to avoid, and it also sports an invasive backlit screen that provides too much stimulus while in bed. A hard no.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the options above, I picked the Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W. Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air-ePaper-Dark-grey-green/dp/B0CHF423CP">color screen version of this tablet</a> is available, but I did not pick it because of Air C’s reduced battery life from the always-on BSR (Boox Super Refresh Technology). BSR allows for a smoother and more responsive experience when writing for example, but that is not actually a problem since I mainly use the Boox to write long streams of text / braindumps, rather than text editing; and BSR also takes it a step closer to a general purpose tablet non-eink display, which starts to defeat the initial purpose. Apart from that, I have a personal preference towards the black and white screen feel.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>

<p>I have now transitioned to not having any mobile phones in my bedroom, and only having the Boox Air 3, the Braun alarm clock, physical books and my Kindle. I am pretty satisfied with this change, which I’ve noticed to provide more focus time after waking up, more time to think, plan my day, reflect, write my thoughts, read, and wind down.</p>

<p>The most fundamental aspect was having more time to focus on my plan for the day, which translated into a substantial improvement on how productive and consequential my days have become. I welcome anyone to give it a try!</p>

<div> BOOX Note Air3 B/W, distractions, Lawnchair Launcher, bloatware, external keyboard
<br />
BOOX Note Air3 B/W被用于减少干扰，安装Lawnchair Launcher来提高效率，禁用多余应用以减少系统负担，使用外接键盘便于书写，效果显著。总结: BOOX Note Air3 B/W通过降低干扰，优化系统，外接键盘等方式提高工作效率，使得专注于书写成为可能。 <div>
<p>As part of the plan to banish mobile phones with access to instant rewards from my bedroom (more on this in an upcoming post), I’ve acquired a Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W, which is a Android tablet with a black and white e-ink screen that is focused on writing and reading <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="house-rules">House Rules</h2>

<p>First of all, <em>why</em> I did get the device in the first place? This was in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce distractions before going to sleep and after waking up, increase focus on the things that really mattered, block out all other noise, and make it really hard to have access to instant gratification and rewards (such as video consumption)</li>
  <li>Register any ideas and thoughts that occur to me before and after going to sleep, which is one of my most proficuous times for such, and then have them available on other devices</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How</em> to achieve this using the BOOX:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only two functionalities should be easy and quick to use:
    <ul>
      <li>Write text and notes (via Google Keep and Google Docs)</li>
      <li>Write diagrams and mental maps (via the device’s main app, which has the snappiest performance)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Getting to above functionalities should be as fast as possible, and they should be fast</li>
  <li>The cost to get to other apps and functionalities should be high</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="focusing--debloating">Focusing &amp; Debloating</h2>

<p>The Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W is not an incredibly fast device, and comes with several functionalities, apps, and a launcher that increase the distraction degree, and also slow down the device.</p>

<h3 id="google-play-google-keep--docs">Google Play, Google Keep &amp; Docs</h3>

<p>The first step towards the objective above was to install Google Play (see <a href="https://help.boox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8569260963732-Google-Play-Store">guide here</a>, and afterwards installed these apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Keep</li>
  <li>Google Docs</li>
  <li>Android Hidden Settings - this app provides access to several hidden settings, that allow the access of settings such as enabling the Developer Options in Android (useful in the debloating process described below)</li>
  <li>Lawnchair (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-launcher-lawnchair">New Launcher: Lawnchair</h3>

<center>
<div class="video-media-caption-wrapper-two"><div class="video-wrapper-two">

             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/minimalist_boox/home_screen_after.png" />
           
         </center></div>
 <p class="media-caption media-caption-two"><b>After:</b> Using Lawnchair Launcher<br class="video-br-end" /></p>
</div>
</center>

<p>The default device’s launcher was replaced by <a href="https://lawnchair.app/">Lawnchair</a>, which is a lightweight, open-source, highly customizable launcher for Android.</p>

<p>What was added to the Lawnchair’s home screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Keep</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Docs</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Onyx Launcher - for any custom changes that are only accessible on the device’s default launcher, which are are in practice, so this was eventually something I removed from the home screen as I wrote this note</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Calendar - to add any events or reminders</li>
  <li>A widget to Onyx Sketch app, which is one the only way I found to have that app directly accessible from the Lawnchair home screen, without having to use Onyx’s launcher to do so. The widget can be added by long pressing on the home screen, then select “Widgets”, and then on the “ContentBrowser” section select one of the “Notes” widgets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disabling-bloatware">Disabling bloatware</h3>

<p>With all of the above in place, we could start disabling non-essential apps and services, to prevent them from running in the background.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to enable “Developer Options”, by accessing the system settings via the “Android Hidden Settings” app above, and then finding the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options">Build Number</a> in order to click it enough times to eventually enable “Developer Options”.</li>
  <li>Connect the BOOX to the computer</li>
  <li>On the computer’s terminal run the below commands</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, these are the commands one can run via the terminal to manage bloat apps:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>// See all packages
$ adb shell pm list packages

// See all disabled packages
$ adb shell pm list packages -d

// Disable a package
$ adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 &lt;package_to_disable&gt;

// Re-enable a package
$ adb shell pm enable &lt;package_to_disable&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br />
And these are the specific ones I used in my BOOX to disable bloatware, without any relevant side effects for my usages:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.appmarket
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.floatingbutton
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.dict
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.mail
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.igetshop
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.easytransfer
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.kime
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.android.ksync
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.calculator
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The commands above should be enough to remove all bloatware, and if you wish to learn more, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/how-to-disable-and-remove-android-bloatware/26993/">this article</a> and <a href="https://digitaluncoded.com/cpu-usage-android">this article</a> provide a good overview.</p>

<h2 id="using-an-external-keyboard">Using an external keyboard</h2>

<p>Given that this device is meant to be used in bed, and since it is quite unwieldy to write on the on-screen display, I was looking for an external keyboard that could be somehow attached to the BOOX, that would bestable, low-maintenance and allowed for flexibility on the writing position.</p>

<p>From the keyboards and keyboard stands I’ve researched, the most elegant solution I found was to use <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/k480-multi-device-wireless.html">Logitech K480</a>, a bluetooth keyboard with an in-built cradle, detachable batteries (i.e. zero issues related internal battery becoming faulty), incredible battery span (some users reported this to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoH2bXoNEE0">in the order of years</a>), and wonderful typing experience.</p>

<p>One caveat is that the BOOX slides backward and falls when using the cradle without any other aid. A very simple fix is to get a piece of cardboard, and place it behind the BOOX (see picture below) to create a better fit. It works remarkably well.</p>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/minimalist_boox/keyboard_k480_with_boox.png" />
           
         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="writing-and-drawing">Writing and Drawing</h2>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>Writing is my main use case for the device, and even though it has some lag when doing it, it works great for me, because I tend to write long streams of ranting text, rather than editing it.</p>

<div>
	<div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The best mode I’ve found for writing was the “A2” Mode. It has ghosting, but is responsive enough for this use case.</p>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/minimalist_boox/configuration_for_writing.png" />
           
         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="drawing">Drawing</h3>

<p>To draw, I use the default Onyx’s Sketch app due to its responsiveness, even though I would have preferred to have a more customizable UI interface and faster ways to share the drawing.</p>

<p>Sharing is one of the downsides of the Onyx Sketch app. You need to either use their cloud service, or export the image in order to get the sketch easily accessible on other devices. I’ve opted to use the export functionality, which allows to directly share the image to a Google Keep note, which fits well into my workflow. I would prefer to not have this extra step, but still, it works well enough.</p>

<div>
	<div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>This has been one of the most satisfying devices I’ve added to my routines, and it’s incredibly satisfying to write on this device, almost distraction free. It allows enough customizability for it to be tailored to my use case, but is also limited enough to deter me from falling prey to distractions.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful towards your journey - do let me know your tips for distraction free environments!</p>

<div> 生物图书，埃隆·马斯克，成就，关系，幽默<br />
埃隆·马斯克的传记展示了他的生活、个人特质、关系和幽默。他的成就展示了不可能是可以实现的，激励着人们去创造和实现目标。然而，这一切并非没有成本，马斯克承受了巨大的痛苦、风险和压力。传记中深入探讨了塑造马斯克的关系以及他对产品质量、设计和制造的不懈追求。同时，书中也揭示了马斯克的幽默感，以及他的"算法"——质疑需求、删除无用部分、简化优化、加快周期时间、自动化。作者深入细节地描绘了马斯克的故事，提供了丰富的数据点，为读者提供了有价值的启示。推荐这本传记给任何人阅读。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
<p>I’ve been hearing the <a href="https://amzn.to/3I97bBi">latest Elon Musk biography</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on audiobook, and just like Ashlee Vance’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3I5hUNu">book</a><sup>1</sup>, I’m finding it incredibly interesting. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="possibilities-monty-python-costs-whys-and-whos">Possibilities, Monty Python, costs, whys and whos</h2>

<h3 id="the-action-on-potential">The action on potential</h3>

<p>I find his path inspiring. It makes me want to create and do things, and shows that many things that are thought to be impossible, are actually achievable. There is a whole realm of opportunities waiting to be grabbed, and his life demonstrates just that.</p>

<p>There is a cost though. If it were that easy, everyone would do it.</p>

<h3 id="the-defining-characteristics">The defining characteristics</h3>

<p>The book goes deeper into the unique aspects that allow Musk to be an extreme overachiever, but also the personal and professional costs those same aspects inflict.</p>

<p>Musk’s capacity to take pain, risk, stress and adversity is staggering. I’ve been reading several biographies over the past years and met quite a few people throughout my life. I can only find a handful of them that are even comparable.</p>

<p>The relentless pursuit, sometimes maniacal, of product quality, functional and non-wasteful design, and effective manufacturing. All in the name of a greater objective, larger than any single human being or corporation.</p>

<h3 id="the-relationships">The relationships</h3>

<p>The book dives into the relationships that shaped Musk (for the better, for the worse, or both), the types of relationships he consistently attracted (which resonated with his personality and upbringing), and essential relationships that allowed him and his projects to thrive.</p>

<p>They come to further prove that no man or woman is an island. You can’t succeed by your own.</p>

<h3 id="the-humor">The humor</h3>

<p>Consistently throughout Musk’s life, there is a balance between dark and light, between lighthearted comedy and downright hell.</p>

<p>I’ve had a good laugh with some of the humorous sides though, such as when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grA5XmBRC6g">eels and hovercrafts</a> were catered to one of his marriages, or when Blue Origin filed a formal protest against SpaceX to prevent the company from having exclusive use of a NASA launchpad, to which Musk <a href="https://spacenews.com/37389musk-calls-out-blue-origin-ula-for-phony-blocking-tactic-on-shuttle-pad/">replied</a> that <em>“if they do somehow show up in the next  5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs. Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.”</em></p>

<p>Shortly after, a SpaceX employee bought dozens of inflatable unicorns and took a picture of them standing in a flame duct 🦄</p>

<h2 id="musks-algorithm">Musk’s algorithm</h2>

<p><em>“The Algorithm”</em>, is a distillation of lessons learned while relentlessly increasing production capacity, which Musk repeatedly preached on his enterprises:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Question every requirement</li>
  <li>Delete any part of the process you can</li>
  <li>Simplify and optimize</li>
  <li>Accelerate cycle time</li>
  <li>Automate</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="questioning-requirements">1. Questioning requirements</h3>

<p>It can be summarized into this: <em>“The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.”</em>. It’s a recurrent theme.</p>

<p>Doesn’t come without a cost though: it is often associated with conflict and chaos.</p>

<h3 id="about-2-delete-any-part-of-the-process-you-can">About 2. Delete any part of the process you can</h3>

<p><em>“Delete, delete, delete”</em></p>

<p>Optimization many times goes hand in hand with deletion. Deleting is hard. It requires letting go of past achievements, comfort, and acceptance that something is not coming back. Almost like a breakup.</p>

<h3 id="simplify-and-optimize">3. Simplify and optimize</h3>

<p>Goes hand in hand with deletion.</p>

<h3 id="accelerate-cycle-time">4. Accelerate cycle time</h3>

<p>This is where intensity and being “hard core” are most leveraged, in my view. Again, with their pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id="automate">5. Automate</h3>

<p>A more obvious one. Put a machine to do it. Easier said than done though.</p>

<h2 id="data-points---cause--effect-probabilities">Data points -&gt; cause &amp; effect probabilities</h2>

<p>I’m fond of biographies because they provide several data points that I can later use in my life. This is, which set of actions preceded a given consequence. Of course the context matters, and surely no same action will lead to the same consequence, specially if made by different people.</p>

<p>But patterns start to emerge, and their respective probabilities. These help me solidify my own personal theories and strategies. Learning from others is important. It allows for “shortcuts” similar to the ones provided by good mentors.</p>

<p>To build these, I need data points, a lot of them.</p>

<p>That is why I like Isaacson’s biographies so much <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is this third book I read (or hear) from Walter Isaacson, and one of the things I enjoy most about his writing is how deep he goes into the details of someone’s story. I believe that details are important when portraying someone’s life. Sometimes, the smallest of events make an immense difference over someone’s path.</p>

<h2 id="just-read--hear-it">Just read / hear it</h2>

<p>Love him, or hate him, I recommend Musk’s biography to just about anyone.</p>

<title>Project Planning Framework</title>

<div> 关键词: 框架, 目标, 时间敏感性, 项目依赖, 不确定性

总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了一个简单的框架，用于将目标确定在三个轴定义的光谱中，从而确定实现目标的方法。作者提出的框架包括时间敏感性、目标/项目之间的依赖程度和步骤不确定性。接着作者分别用三个场景说明了如何应用该框架。第一个场景是合规性，时间敏感性高，依赖程度低，步骤不确定性低。第二个场景是增加用户流程效率，时间敏感性低，依赖程度低，步骤不确定性高。第三个场景是将多个系统统一为一个，时间敏感性低，依赖程度高，步骤不确定性中等。最后，作者强调了框架的简单性，并鼓励读者在使用框架时考虑可能的缺失参数。 <div>
<p>Different goals require different roadmapping and planning techniques.</p>

<p>In this post, a simple framework is proposed to pin a goal into a spectrum defined by three axes, the combination of which informing the approach taken to reach the goal. The three axes of this framework are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: how much leeway is there to extend the deadline to deliver a goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: how many steps are needed to reach the goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: how sure are we that a given step will move us toward the goal?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-of-how-to-apply-the-framework">Example of how to apply the Framework</h2>

<h3 id="scenario-1-compliance">Scenario 1: Compliance</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>An external entity (let’s say, government or partner company), has made a set of requirements for which your team must provide compliance for on a fixed, non-negotiable timeline, with limited team capacity. The “definition of done” is well defined by this entity, and there is a low amount of unknowns of how to reach the goals.</p>

<h4 id="axes">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: High</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: Low</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>

<p>This goal has sensitive timelines and is archetypal top-down. The deadline will be reached in one way or the other, so all hands are needed on deck to tackle this goal.</p>

<p>Useful approaches could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a Gant-style chart, where there is a heavy emphasis on the timeline</li>
  <li>Stricter project management, more process driven</li>
</ul>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.png" />
           
         </center>

<h3 id="scenario-2-increase-effectiveness-of-a-user-flow">Scenario 2: Increase Effectiveness of a User Flow</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement-1">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>Your team supports a user flow, such as a check-out flow, for which the goal is the increase the conversion amount by <em>X</em>. There are known levers you have available to drive this metric, but also many others which are unbeknownst and would need experimentation and research. This increase is not business critical, so there is an underlying lenience in case the goal is not hit.</p>

<h4 id="axes-1">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: High</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach-1">Approach</h4>

<p>Unlike Scenario 1, which is exploitation heavy, this scenario favors an approach which is exploration heavy, due to the high amount of uncertainty of which projects will be able to move the needle towards the successful completion of the goal. To de-risk and address this goal, a high level of adaptability will be needed, and several opportunities will need to be created to discover which levers can be used.</p>

<p>Useful approaches could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have open ended brainstorming sessions</li>
  <li>User research and focus groups</li>
  <li>Looser project management, to allow for quick and less trashier pivots</li>
</ul>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/project_planning_framework/effectiveness.png" />
           
         </center>

<h3 id="scenario-3-unification-of-several-systems-into-one">Scenario 3: Unification of Several Systems into One</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement-2">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>Your team is tasked to unify several internal systems into a single one, where several dependencies between different projects exist, and the time each project will take ranges from certain to unknown.</p>

<h4 id="axes-2">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: High</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: Low / Medium</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach-2">Approach</h4>

<p>The focus here should be on making clear which are the dependencies between different projects, and allow some leniency towards the completion of each of the projects, while actively managing the team’s capacity to focus on the projects which are discovered to require a heavier lift</p>

<p>Useful approaches could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A full dependency graph, allowing for each of the projects timelines to have some leeway where needed</li>
  <li>Incentivize highly structured systems design documents and discussions, making sure that all involved parties are aligned on a given approach, and engineers are able to explain not only the system they own, but also the other systems involved in their unification</li>
</ul>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/project_planning_framework/unification.png" />
           
         </center>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>The framework above is quite simple and could potentially be used for several other different use cases. It might also be missing some essential parameters that are missing for your specific goal. If you do find such, I would be happy to know. Regardless, hope the above can be useful on your next roadmapping cycle</p>

<div> 关键词：ephemeral nature, digital persistence, physical medium, book, Benjamin Franklin

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了数字内容的短暂性以及如何延长其寿命。作者提到了通过分配第三方或使用自持续数字机制来保持博客的在线存在，但这两种方法都有缺点。最终，作者推荐将内容保存到物理媒介，即书籍，以延长其存在的可能性。文章还提到了一些书籍对如何将想法转化成实质内容的启发，并分享了自己的计划，包括继续出版博客并将其编成书。<br /> <div>
<p>There is an ephemeral nature to everything. That includes me, you and this blog. This blog is currently <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/lopespm.github.com">hosted in GitHub</a>, and nothing guarantees that after I’m long gone, or even before, GitHub might cease to exist. How to account for that?</p>

<p>One way to keep these writings alive, would be to assign a third person with the task of keeping this establishment online. What happens when that person is gone though? It’s turtles all the way down.</p>

<p>Another way would be to find a self sustainable digital mechanism to keep this blog alive, ie, a bot. That has its own issues as well, since technologies change and distributed systems like <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> come and go.</p>

<p>The other option to extend the lifespan of these digital contents is to have these writings persisted into a physical medium. A book. No maintenance required. As long as it can be kept safe from unfortunate <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning">book burning events</a>, the probability that a single copy remains alive, and can be made accessible (such as a public library) to someone and hopefully improve their life, increases.</p>

<h2 id="no-input-no-output">No Input, No Output</h2>

<p>The jump from a humble blog to a book is quite a leap. Outrageous even. Perhaps doable.</p>

<p>Some of the books I’ve recently read gave me some guidance and ideas on how to take that germinal idea into fruition (<em>note that the following links are affiliate links, and as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases whose commissions help this small establishment, <u>at no additional cost to you</u></em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rolf Dobelli’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3NJ12is">The Art of the Good Life</a> is a collection of 52 articles that Dobelli wrote for a newspaper column.</li>
  <li>Dobelli also previously wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/3NGItvC">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a> (I did not read this one), which reveals the most common errors of judgment, and how to avoid them, throughout 99 short chapters. Although the idea the idea of 99 chapters seems to have been <a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm">original to Nassim Taleb’s</a> project to publish “99 (convex) heuristics”</li>
  <li>Steven Bartlett shares on his <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbDNas">Diary of a CEO book</a> that at 21 years old, he made a promise to himself that every day at 7PM, he would write a tweet or make a video delivering a single idea, and then post it online at 8PM, which Steven claims to have been the habit the most difference to advance his knowledge and skills. It completely changed his life trajectory, and consequently it’s the piece of advice Steven most strongly urges for anyone looking to be a better thinker, speaker, writer, or content creator. The key here was that he made it a daily obligation, not just an interest.
    <ul>
      <li>From this, I assume that this habit was foundational to his <a href="https://stevenbartlett.com/the-diary-of-a-ceo-podcast/">Diary of a CEO podcast</a>, which eventually resulted in the book above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After listening to <a href="https://amzn.to/3GYxlq6">Benjamin Franklin’s biography</a> on audiobook, I’ve came to learn that not only was Franklin a statesman, diplomat, scientist and inventor, but also a prolific writer, printer and publisher, which were unbeknownst to me. As a publisher, Benjamin Franklin wrote several dissertations and essays <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (such as the ones under the pen name of Silence Dogood), which I’m sure to have fed into Franklin’s books, which brought many interesting ideas to a large population, like his own <a href="https://amzn.to/4aG58ly">autobiography</a>, which could be seen as a compilation of several of his ideas and reflections / writings (these go hand in hand).</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from finding the above points inspirational, they also make me think that creating a discipline where I consistently share my reflections and experiences via writing or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VHNCq3yGJrLn82VsdONOg">videos</a>, not only helps me <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html">solidify my thoughts</a> and provides more immediate feedback on how valuable these are to its viewers / readers (which allows me to course correct and iterate <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>), but also provides the building blocks to put together a hopefully meaningful and concise book to help surpass the limited lifespan of the digital medium that hosts this blog and my YouTube videos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No Input, No Output</p>

  <p><em>― Joe Strummer, lead singer of The Clash</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-path-towards-physical-persistence">The Path Towards Physical Persistence</h2>

<p>Given the above, here are some action points to put the wheels in motion towards building “physical persistence” via a book, and give better chances for its memes to transcend their host <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My low priority 2024 <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html">goal</a> is continuing to publish blog notes and videos. The numeric goal I’ve set for myself is to publish 12 blog notes, about once per month. From these, make the respective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VHNCq3yGJrLn82VsdONOg">YouTube videos</a>, but this would be a stretch sub-goal (albeit, one that I really enjoy)
    <ul>
      <li>This was a consequence of my recent “personal performance” review for this year’s personal goals, which was a good opportunity to reflect on what went well, what went less well, what was achieved, and what was missed. One of the aspects that I aim to implement for the <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html">upcoming year’s goals</a> is to use numeric goals, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once 50 or 99 meaningful blog notes are written, attempt to compile them into a book.
    <ul>
      <li>Why 50 or 99? Upon reaching 50 notes, I might feel that not enough substantial content was generated to be distilled into a book. Once 99 notes are reached however, it would be more certain that enough meaningful content was accumulated (hopefully). I would expect the distillation process to remove several notes that would be deemed to have less quality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Looking forward to 2024! 🎉</p>

<br /><br />人类将面临越来越智能的机器取代。然而，人类的情感和情感联结以及对现实世界复杂性的处理能力仍然是机器无法取代的优势。因此，人们应该努力接近人与人之间的联系，并专注于为人们或企业提供有形的价值。通过这种简单的思维方式，人们将能够获得丰富的（金钱、情感等）价值，并提供这些价值。<br /><br />总结: <div>
<p>Words are cheap and keep getting cheaper. The last notes on this blog could have been written via generative AI, and as time goes by, new generative models will likely create higher quality content than I could ever would, consistently.</p>

<p>I didn’t use these because the <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html">writing process comes as a form of thinking</a>, but if there are automated mechanisms that increasingly outperform us humans in so many different areas, what does that leave us?</p>

<h2 id="human-connection">Human connection</h2>

<p>How comfortable would you be in having a relationship with a being that is orders of magnitude more intelligent and capable than you? Not just logical-mathematical intelligence, but emotional, linguistic, musical or even spatial intelligence.</p>

<p>A being so advanced that any form of communication or relationship between you and it would always be severely constrained, even with neural interfaces. A being so advanced that you would never be able to have an essential understanding of it. A being so advanced that you wouldn’t even know that you are being manipulated by it. How many humans do you know who are friends with chimpanzees or bonobos, our closest relatives?</p>

<p>We are still human beings, with all the perks and limitations that come with it.</p>

<p>I would claim that humans will always be attracted to their familiar counterparts. Other beings that share their own struggles and limitations, and by consequence, what they create and share. Machines have their important place in the world, and history has proven to us that life as whole improved as technology evolved to serve us, but it would be healthier for us to think of them as tools, rather than human replacements.</p>

<h2 id="bioengineered">Bioengineered</h2>

<p>We have been fitted with extraordinary senses and tools that allow us to efficiently interact with the world. It took milenea for nature to shape us, and as Leonardo da Vinci puts it when comparing natural to artificial structures: “Nature made the most perfect inventions. There is nothing superfluous, there is nothing lacking” (paraphrased)</p>

<h3 id="our-place">Our place</h3>

<p>Try having a machine fixing the leaky pipe in your bathroom, or to change your desk’s lightbulb. Odds are that you’ll be flooded and in the dark in the nearterm. There will come a point where they will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpraXaw7dyc">likely do that</a>, but we are still not there.</p>

<p>Machines / tools currently outperform us in several tasks on the digital realm, and in several heavy duty physical tasks. But when it comes to fine digital dexterity, human connection, and interaction with the real world and its complexities, we still have an edge.</p>

<h2 id="future-proofing">Future Proofing</h2>

<p>Take a look at the daily tasks in your job. How repetitive are they? If they are repetíve, how much of a human element is present? Look at your organization and see where rubber meets the road in terms of human connection and physical intervention.</p>

<p>Strive to be closer to that human interface and focus on delivering tangible value to people or businesses (group of people). With this simple mindset, I believe you’ll be in a safer place, surrounded with an abundant supply of meaningful (monetary, emotional, etc) value that you can extract and provide.</p>

这篇文章是一位游客对纽约的全面游记。作者分享了如何利用谷歌地图的事先准备，以及游览时的经验。他介绍了多个博物馆，包括平流层博物馆和大都会艺术博物馆。此外，他还探索了娱乐活动，如百老汇表演和喜剧俱乐部。文章还提到了一些值得游览的地方，如自由女神像和中央公园。最后，作者介绍了在纽约的交通方式，包括步行、渡轮和地铁。整体而言，这篇文章是一份详尽的纽约旅行指南和个人体验分享。<br /> <div>
<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide"></div>
</div>

<p>I’ve recently been to NYC. It was one of the most interesting experiences I’ve ever had.</p>

<p>Each one has their own perspectives when visiting the city, and I’ve asked several people about theirs before the trip, which helped immensely when planning out my itinerary. Now it’s my time to pay it forward. Here my guide / personal perspective of New York.</p>

<h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>

<p>Having a pre-curated list of points of interest on Google Maps was one of the most useful and time efficient aspects of the entire trip. This allowed me to quickly improvise and make the most of my surroundings, since I could just look at the map to check which nearby places could I visit at any given time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/e6z91pon4Lco8r6F8">Points of Interest Map</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/swXwxeps7uAJWcno9">Restaurants Map</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall"></div>
</div>

<h2 id="museums">Museums</h2>

<p>I didn’t consider myself to be an excessive photographer. I’ve discovered on this trip that I was probably wrong. I can’t recall the last time I took so many photos, it was like I was in an outstanding candy store of visual goodies.</p>

<h3 id="intrepid-museum">Intrepid Museum</h3>

<p>Let’s start with fashion. I’ve been pointed out that my glasses make me look nerdy / square / too serious / too much like an engineer. Well, thanks to this museum piece, I can now say they were developed for space walks:</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide"></div>
</div>

<p>Oh, and look back and you will also see the Space Shuttle <em>Enterprise</em>, the first orbiter of the Space Shuttle system:</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
</div>

<p>You can find these glasses, the space shuttle, sit inside the Mercury capsule or A-6 Intruder cockpit, see real life jet planes like the Lockheed A-12, in the Intrepid museum.</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
</div>

<p>Where is the Intrepid museum? The museum is an World War II–era aircraft carrier. Yes, the vessel <em>is</em> the museum. You can explore several of it’s interior sections, including the bridge, living quarters, gun and bomb bays, go through the same narrow escalator that pilots took to the flight deck, all of these throughout several floors and different explorable rooms</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
</div>

<p>Right beside the Intrepid lies USS Growler, a diesel powered submarine retrofitted to deliver Regulus nuclear missiles, as a form of nuclear deterrence during Cold War. You can go inside the submarine and get an intimate experience of how it’s lived throughout their 2 month patrols, where they faced the constant scenario of being called upon to launch a nuclear missile onto Russian soil, destroying not only their target, but most likely kill themselves on the process, since the process to launching / reloading Regulus missiles was long and would expose this submarine to enemy reconnaissance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since it was a diesel submarine, it required to be at surface or near surface level (it was not possible to push out their exhaust gasses when deep in the ocean) to enable a set of its 3 engines to charge its on-board batteries that would power the submarine and its electric motors.</li>
  <li>It also needed to be periodically refueled, so the submarine ran a long circular patrol in the Pacific Ocean to refuel to eventually sit near Russian enemy lines for dozens of days.</li>
  <li>The crew had to maintain absolute secrecy about their mission, and none of their partners knew the context of it</li>
  <li>The families of the crew members knew nothing about their mission, and that if they did launch a nuclear missile, they would be exposed, and most likely be killed as they expose themselves to launch the nuclear load (not to mention the annihilation that comes from the nuclear warhead)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found the underlying story and details of this submarine and this mission were so interesting, that right after the tour, I went immediately in search of staff members to ask a series of questions that came about during the visit. They were very kindly and patiently took the time to answer them, and one of the ladies even asked me if I was an engineer. I’m not sure what gave that away. It was either the questions, or my glasses :)</p>

<h3 id="met">MET</h3>

<p>MET, or Metropolitan Museum of Art, has two locations: the museum in Fifth Avenue is the most famous one and is often referred to when mentioning MET. The other lesser known branch is in Upper Manhattan, the MET Cloisters.</p>

<h4 id="met-fifth-avenue">MET: Fifth Avenue</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you like the British Museum, you will love MET on Fifth Avenue</li>
  <li>They reconstructed the 10 BCE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Dendur">Temple of Dendur</a> Roman Egyptian religious structure, which originally located in Tuzis (later Dendur). Must I say more?</li>

  <div class="image-mosaic-card"></div>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>This massive museum spans through classical antiquity and ancient Egypt; paintings and sculptures from nearly all the European masters; and an extensive collection of American and modern art. All of these are intertwined with large thematic rooms where the installations are beautiful to behold. If you are going to see a single museum in New York, this should be the one.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the last books I’ve listen on audiobook was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson/dp/074325807X">Walter Isaacson’s Benjamin Franklin biography</a>, where one of passages goes through the story of how a Duplessis’ painting of Franklyn’s portrait came to be. This <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436236?pkgids=367&amp;pos=1&amp;nextInternalLocale=en&amp;ft=*&amp;oid=436236&amp;rpp=4&amp;exhibitionId=%7Bfc6dc1eb-bea2-4986-afc2-1cd8b02db3ee%7D&amp;pg=1">1778 painting can be seen in the museum</a>, and curiously enough, Franklyn’s depiction on <a href="https://www.uscurrency.gov/denominations/100"><span>$</span>100 bills from 1914 to 1990</a> had him wearing a fur coat, just like this painting.</p>

<h4 id="met-cloisters">MET: Cloisters</h4>

<p>With the same ticket, one can visit the Cloisters and the 5th Avenue museum on the same day. The Cloisters museum is America’s only museum dedicated exclusively to the art and architecture of the Middle Ages, and is smaller than the 5th Avenue one. Still there much to explore not only inside the museum, but also on its surroundings</p>

<h3 id="national-history-museum">National History Museum</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I lost count of the amount of dinosaur skeletons I’ve seen in the natural history museum. And nothing quite prepares you to see a gigantic skeleton of a Titanosaur. It’s so big that its head extends outside of its new home in the Museum’s fourth-floor gallery.</li>
  <li>I’ve learned while browsing the museum about mass dinosaur graves and their relationship to draughts, and went through thought provoking sections, such as the presentation of a massive turtle specimen, that if it were to be extinct it would probably be right part of our imaginary and event movies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another thought that stuck to me is how deeply connected we are to other animals, Earth and outer space. Seeing life sized representations of several of these makes them immediately more relatable.</p>

<p>On Saturdays, from 5 to 8 pm, admission to the museum is “Pay What You Wish”, for a minimum of <span>$</span>1. I would recommend doing so, since the museum can be easily visited in less than one hour, and in my opinion, it’s more about the building than the pieces themselves</p>

<p>Broadway shows are a hallmark of NYC, although if you are from London or Europe, I would recommend not seeing shows that are already available in London. For example, I’ve heard that Hamilton is better seen in London, due to the larger contextual part that King George has in the UK.</p>

<p>The Chicago musical is a good bet, and is the one I’ve attended to, it is the second longest-running show ever to run on Broadway, behind only The Phantom of the Opera</p>

<h3 id="comedy">Comedy</h3>

<p>Comedy Cellar is a comedy club in Manhattan where many top New York comedians perform, and where several comedians started, like Louis C.K. or Dave Chappelle. I found it be have down to earth, edgy comedy, and you are asked to leave your phone in a pouch, which I believe to increase presence of the entire crowd, but also provides extra freedom to comedians, given to how powerful cancel culture can be</p>

<h2 id="points-of-interest">Points of Interest</h2>

<h3 id="statue-of-liberty">Statue of Liberty</h3>

<p>You can get the Staten Island Ferry from the Whitehall terminal, for <em>free</em>. On your way to the terminal, several people will try to sell and cajole you into payed trips to the Statue of Liberty trips. The ferry is more than enough.
- The ferry runs <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/siferryschedule.shtml">every 30 minutes</a>, 24 hours per day, for most of the days, and travel time is approximately 25 minutes.
- Once you get to Staten Island, you can either take some time to explore it, or just return immediately to Manhattan, by exiting the ferry, by entering St. George’s Ferry Terminal, and entering the boarding gates for the next ferry.
- When entering the Whitehall terminal, enter through the right side of the ferry in order to be on the same side that the Statue of Liberty will appear. If entering on St. George’s Ferry Terminal, enter through the left side of the ferry. Regardless, you can easily change sides when inside the ferry
- Most of the people will likely go to the top floor with larger windows, which will eventually get crowded. I recommend instead to take the bottom floor, and find a window that is already opened. The view is much clearer (since you don’t have a worn down piece of glass obfuscating the view), you can sit comfortably near the window, and you won’t need to fight a crowd (in principle)</p>

<p>Upon the southern end of the High Line park, you can view Little Island, and quickly walk to it. Little Island is an artificial island park, with some beautiful views and interesting layout</p>

Those same brokers and traders are now surrounded by computers that manage the majority of the buying and selling of stocks for their various accounts. Floor trading still exists, but it is responsible for a rapidly diminishing share of market activity.</li>
  <li>The Charging Bull of Wall Street is not really located on Wall Street itself, but it is quite near. The bull in finance represents optimism and growth. The statue on Wall Street represents the same ideas.</li>
  <li>The Federal Hall is a historic building, whose original building served as New York’s first City Hall and hosted the 1765 Stamp Act Congress before the American Revolution. With the establishment of the United States federal government in 1789, it was renamed Federal Hall, as it hosted the 1st Congress and was where George Washington was sworn in as the nation’s first president. The current structure was built as the U.S. Custom House for the Port of New York before serving as a Subtreasury building from 1862 to 1925, and the current national memorial commemorates the historic events that occurred at the previous structure.</li>

<h3 id="citigroup-center">Citigroup Center</h3>

<p>Due to material changes during construction, the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/z4F9FgXe4QfVZvux5">building</a> as initially completed was structurally unsound. To save money, Bethlehem Steel changed the plans in 1974 to use bolted joints, and wind loads were calculated from perpendicular winds, as required under the building code; in typical buildings, loads from quartering winds at the corners would be less.</p>

<p>In June 1978, after an inquiry from an engineering student, the structural engineer recalculated the wind loads on the building with quartering winds, and found these to significantly increase the load at the bolted joints, and that a wind capable of toppling Citicorp Center would occur every 55 years on average.</p>

<p>Starting in August 1978, construction crews covertly fixed the issue, and six weeks into the work, a major storm was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. The reinforcement was only half-finished, with New York City hours away from emergency evacuation. The storm eventually turned eastward and veered out to sea. The repairs were finished successfully, and no major issues happened ever since.</p>

There are food stalls which are incredible though. One of these is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9xwJBkt5n1bpkY87">Shawarma Bay</a>, just a block away from Radio City Music Hall. Incredible food, although it can gain quite a queue, which can take about 30 minutes, as it was my case. Worth the wait though– cops were eating there</li>

  <li>This all depends on your budget, activities you would like to do, who is going with you, etc. But in general, I would advise on staying in Manhattan island, or at least near to a transport connection that can get you quickly to the city center, since it is where most of the points of interest are located, and transport links are quite good from there. Most likely you will also be in your lodging to sleep, and not much else.</li>
  <li>If looking for a hostel, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2EjoFJnZMMGqhC8N7">HI New York City Hostel</a> is a good one. It even sports free weekly comedy sessions every Sunday night. It’s located near Central Park, and you can’t go wrong with this one. In general, you can search through https://www.hostelworld.com/ and book through there, it was quite reliable for the two bookings I did.</li>
  <li>If looking for something more comfortable, citizenM Hotels are of incredible good value and location. Apart from the comfortable rooms that have nice view already, on Bowery it even has rooftop terrace with an amazing view of the city</li>

<h3 id="money--how-to-pay">Money / How to Pay</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stores, food establishments (even chains), bodegas / delis, 7-11s, etc present their prices as pre-tax. New York City sales tax ranges from 4% to 8.875%, and <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/listings_of_taxable_and_exempt_food.htm">some products are exempt from it</a>.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to tip everywhere. On restaurants it is customary to tip 20%. There is some debate about whether you should calculate the tip on the amount before or after tax.</li>
  <li>You don’t really need cash. You do need it if you want to buy from street vendors, or if you want to dodge the additional cost that certain sellers impose on card transactions (like the shawarma above)  </li>
  <li>On restaurants and entertainment venues, it is common practice for the attendant to leave with the credit card, to later return with an attached invoice that is meant to be signed and filled with the tipping amount.
    <ul>
      <li>It also happened to me that when trying to pay by contactless card to a market vendor, the card kept being rejected, and since the card insertion feature was not available, the vendor wrote down the card number and details into the system to proceed with the payment. That failed as well, because the card got blocked by my bank due to a false-positive suspected fraud, as I later discovered. Eventually I just payed with cash to resolve the issue.</li>
      <li>As an European, the practice of being physically separated from the card, verification via signature, and freely writing down credit card numbers strike me as quite unsecure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="getting-around--transportation">Getting Around / Transportation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Walking is one of the best ways to discover the city. Sidewalks are broad, the city is grid shaped (so expect to be given coordinates in the form of street / avenue to pinpoint a place), and pedestrian lights and timings ran standard everywhere I visited. I did the large majority of my exploration of the city over the span of 180km throughout 4 days. Extra tip: if you are used to barefoot shoes, wearing <a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/rw/">firm ground outsole Vivos</a> to do so is amazing. My feet were sore, but happy.</li>
  <li>Walking through the perpendicular numbered streets and avenues is an absolute bliss, and makes it quite easy to navigate through them. Several times I just looked at the map and quickly memorized something like “3 right, 2 left”, which translated to “cross 3 roads and turn right, and then cross 2 roads and turn left”. This would keep me walking going for a long time and have time to appreciate the surroundings, without the need to constantly check the map.</li>
  <li>Ferry boats are a great way to sight the city, for a low price (<span>$</span>4 for a one way-ticket), and you can buy these tickets through the NYC Ferry app or a ticket vending machine.</li>
  <li>Subway and Bus now have OMNI, which just means that you can tap in with your credit / debit card. Each ride costs <span>$</span>2.90, and there are no different prices for different zones. This has a [rolling 7 day price cap] (https://omny.info/fares), so you never pay more than <span>$</span>34 over that period.
    <ul>
      <li>Metro Card is the pre-paid version of this. You need one, buy them directly from the machines to avoid being scammed. For example, a 7-Day Unlimited MetroCard costs <span>$</span>34 upfront, and can be used any number of times during those 7 days.
        <ul>
          <li>Be aware that if you swipe in, get out from the station, and then attempt to shortly swipe in again, it will reject your swipe, due to being too recent. If that happens, ask an MTA attendant to let you in (if available), or do like many others and wait for someone to crack open the emergency exit from the inside. If you hear an alarm going off in the station, most likely is because someone opened the emergency exit to let others in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Just like routine events such as figuring out post-tax prices purchases or how much and when to tip require some kind of mental effort, figuring out the different edge cases of the subway system will keep your mind busy. It is like there is a perpetual rat race game being played in the city.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes trains stop at all stations, sometimes they don’t, sometimes trains have indicators of which station you are in, sometimes they don’t, sometimes the station has (non-standard) indications of how much time it takes for the next train to arrive, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes it rains heavily inside the stations, sometimes it doesn’t.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Something unexpected to me, which cannot be transmitted through visual media, is the collection of smells around New York, in almost all parts of the city, except a set of parks and neighborhoods mostly outside Manhattan. The smell of garbage (since it is comment that it accumulates in heaps of bags on city sidewalks), burnt street meat, horse manure in some parts of Central Park, a smell I can only describe as pervasive detergent / laundry smell that could even be detected inside several buildings like the MET and Delis; the strong smell of road paint (since it appears that several of the streets were recently repainted), and signature smells from the subway</li>
  <li>Several subway lines are relatively shallow, so they are easily heard at street level. They also generally run below the roads themselves, which I would assume to make it easier when building incredibly high skyscrapers whose foundations run quite deep.</li>
  <li>Be attentive of your surroundings and where you walk, such dodging through garbage debris and sidewalk cellar doors, be them open or <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2015/01/26/man-dies-falling-through-cellar-doors-in-brooklyn/">closed</a></li>
  <li>Be prepared to encounter people who are not as well off, and might be living in the streets. Use your judgment, keep out of confusions, be respectable and don’t engage with people who have serious mental issues. If you are in a rougher area, memorize your path when possible, and stop at a local shop if you need to get your bearings right. Use your common sense</li>
  <li>You might have noticed that I didn’t mention the common Edge / Top of the Rock / Summit One / Empire State Building / etc observation decks. It’s not that I don’t enjoy incredible views, but it didn’t fall high enough on the list of priorities, specially because I’ve had the opportunity to have skyline views through other buildings I’ve passed by, such as the Hotel.</li>
  <li>I tend to like long trans-atlantic flights, since they provide a moment of low stimuli, where there is less incentive to use the internet. My personal piece of advice would be to avoid the usual in-flight entertainment. I love to use them to resume a book or to write down my reflections from a trip for example (several of article lines were written during the return flight)</li>
  <li>This only shows my ignorance, but I had no idea that so many well-known artists were originally from New York, like Jay-Z (Brooklyn), Cardi B (South Bronx), Spike Lee (Brooklyn), and of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RciKM866Rhk">Jenny from the block</a>. That explains why I’ve consecutively heard “Empire State of Mind”, from Jay-Z and Alicia Keys (Hell’s Kitchen), and “All I want for Christmas is You”, from Mariah Carey (raised in Huntington).</li>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ever since I was a kid I had considerable fascination with the USA. The culture that arrived through the small and big screens, the big companies and entrepreneurs that I admired, the language, the people I’ve met along the way, the stories. Having had the opportunity to visit it and experience first hand was a true privilege. I’ve lived it like it was the last time I would visit it, and it imprinted in me several thoughts and perspectives that I’m sure will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>New York ain’t no DisneyLand, and Elmo’s pictures in Times Square don’t come for free either, so set expectations accordingly. It can be one of the most fulfilling experiences you’ll ever have. I advise you to come prepared and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Frank Sinatra sang that he wants “to wake up in the city that doesn’t sleep”. That phrase has a deep meaning that only struck me upon my trip. The city does not indeed sleep. Times Square lights, 24 hour subway, the constant movement. Living in NYC does wake you up, not only literally, but also figuratively. It wakes you up towards a different reality that keeps you on your toes in several ways. In a way, it’s a celebration of life.</p>

<title>Relative Cost / Benefit of an Investment</title>

<div> 投资成本, 使用率, 产出, 比较, 规则简化

总结:
这篇文章通过简化的例子，介绍了投资成本与使用率之间的关系，并将其应用到不同的场景中。关键点是，一项投资如果闲置不用，将会产生较高的相关成本。文章提供了一些例子，如租房、学习工作、购买衣物等，通过计算每小时或每次使用的成本，展示了投资的成本效益。这种简化的启发式方法可以在不同的情况下作为一个做决策的参考。文章还提到了一些额外的成本和利益，如其他直接和间接成本，以及可能的资产回收等，以及这些例子与初衷的对比和期望。虽然这种简化没有考虑到所有的因素，但可以帮助我们更好地评估投资所带来的效益。 <div>
<p>Let’s say you spend <span>$</span>1,000 to acquire film equipment (camera, microphones, and lights) to shoot YouTube videos. If you use this equipment to film and publish 2 videos, it means that each of those videos costs <span>$</span>500 to produce. If 100 videos are published, each of them cost <span>$</span>10. If all of these videos are able to generate <span>$</span>10 of revenue, then the entire cost of the initial investment was amortized.</p>

<p>The above is a severely gross simplification<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the key point is that an investment left unused has a high associated cost. In the case above, if only two videos were to be produced, then it would have been a better idea to rent the equipment instead.</p>

<p>This simple heuristic of mapping the investment cost to its usage and upside, can be a potential rule of thumb in different scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="other-examples">Other Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apartment Rent</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You are renting an apartment for <span>$</span>1,000 per month. During the week you work in an office, on weekends you are sometimes out, and during the year you take sporadic vacations outside. Let’s say that, on average, you spend 14 hours per day on your apartment, including sleep → 14 hours * 30 days = 420 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that it costs costs about <span>$</span>33 per day to live in the apartment, or <span>$</span>2.3 per hour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Study → Work → Net Worth Gain</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You studied 30 hours per week for 3 years (30 hours per week * 52 weeks * 3 years = 4680 hours) to land a job that increases your net worth <span>$</span>10.000 every year (on average), for 30 years. A total of <span>$</span>300,000 of networth gains.</li>
      <li>This means that you will gain about <span>$</span>64 for each hour invested in studying, or $274 per day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clothing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy pair of trousers for <span>$</span>50, and wear them twice per month throughout for 2 years (24 months * 2 times per month = 48 times these were used).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs about <span>$</span>1 to wear them each time.
        <ul>
          <li>By contrast, if these trousers were only used <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost">7 times</a>, it would cost about <span>$</span>7.14 to wear them each time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a Playstation 5 for <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console"><span>$</span>499.99</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/01/ps4_has_a_very_high_software_attach_rate_average_player_owns_around_ten_games">10 games</a> (<span>$</span>60 each) totalling <span>$</span>1.100. You play <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/ld7zuo/what_was_your_total_amount_of_hours_played_in_2020/">60 hours per year</a> during 5 years (60 hours * 5 years = 300 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that each playing hour costs about <span>$</span>3.6.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phone</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy an iPhone 15 Pro for <span>$</span>999, and use it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59952557">4.8 hours per day</a> during <a href="https://www.iphonelife.com/content/how-long-do-iphone-last-how-to-know-when-to-upgrade-your-iphone">2 years</a> (4.8 hours * 365 days * 2 years = 3504 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.29 per hour of active usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Computer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a MacBook Pro 13” for <span>$</span>$1299, and <a href="https://mediapeanut.com/how-long-should-a-macbook-pro-last/">use it</a> 3 times per week for 2.5 hours per session, throughout 7 years (3 times per week * 2.5 hours * 52 weeks per year * 7 years = 2730 hours)</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.48 per hour of usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Musical Instrument</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a guitar for <span>$</span>100. You play the guitar once per week, for one hour, during 2 years. 52 weeks * 1 hour * 2 years = 104 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour playing the guitar has a cost of <span>$</span>1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Video Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a standard Netflix subscription that costs <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926/us"><span>$</span>15.99 per month</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/advisor/vpn/netflix-statistics">3.2 hours</a> (3.2 hours * 30 days = 96 hours per month) of videos throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This mean that each hour costs about $0.17.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Audio Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a premium Spotify subscription that costs <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"><span>$</span>10.99 per month</a>, and listen to about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813876/spotify-monthly-active-users-time-spent-listening/">25 hours</a> of music and podcasts throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour costs about <span>$</span>0.44.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We could go on with further examples, as this simple heuristic could be applied to several scenarios, and the cost cost benefit analysis could have any perspective one so desires, but I would invite you to visit your storage and search for something you acquired long ago that got used less times than expected, and do a rough calculation of what was it’s relative cost / benefit.
The same for any other investment you did in the past.</p>

<p>Was it a surprising result?</p>

<p>How did it stack up against your initial expectations?</p>

<p><br /></p>

      <p><em>This gross simplification is meant to keep the example simple, and does not take into account other direct and indirect costs, such as the computer needed to edit the videos, electricity costs, office space costs, labor costs. It also does not take into account the gained equity, this is, you could sell the equipment and get some of that investment back. This was not considered because if the equipment breaks its value is rendered to zero, and when / if it is sold, it would be for a fraction at the initial value, not only because its inherent value would likely decrease through the years, but also because of inflation.</em><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Importance of Goal Clarity for Delegation</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/09/30/goal_clarity_in_delegation.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/09/30/goal_clarity_in_delegation.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Summary: 在文章中，作者提到了75/25规则，即如果你对某个项目/任务的执行者正确执行的可能性约为75%，那么就可以进行委托。剩下的25%空间是为了让该人学习、探索、犯错误、创新和成长。
如果决定委托项目/任务，接下来会发生什么呢？
目标清晰
作者在委托工作时面临的一个常见挑战是，在交付工作后，结果往往是不可预测和无法控制的。这种非结构化的方法经常让我思考如何通过减少委托范围来减少未完成风险，并且给被委派者带来了困惑，不知道他们应该如何进行。
来自《Who not How》一书的一点信息提供了解决这个问题的指导和结构：

(…) 研究发现，团队在具有高度自治但目标不明确以及缺乏绩效反馈的情况下，表现比低度自治的团队要差。
据上述研究称，具有高度自治、目标明确和定期反馈结果的团队的表现会飙升。
除了定期反馈外，目标清晰非常重要，尽管听起来很明显，但在委托过程中可能会被忽视和淹没。
实践中的明确性
在意识到上述问题后，对于每个委托的工作，我把明确预期结果、服务完成的定义、重要的里程碑和截止日期、什么时候应该向我汇报问题以及每个参与者的责任作为首要任务。
所有上述内容都以明确而简洁的方式进行沟通，并且最好以公开文件形式进行记录，以增加问责性和减少歧义（根据情况，仅口头沟通这些可能已经足够，特别是对于简单的任务）。
委派公式
基于以上情况，委派公式如下：
委派 = [75/25规则 -> 目标明确 + 自主权 + 定期反馈] <div>
<p>Previously, in <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/2022/03/22/learnings-software-engineer-techlead.html">“Learnings as a Software Engineer Techlead”</a>, I’ve alluded to the 75/25 rule, where if you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors, innovate and grow.</p>

<p>If the project/task was decided to be delegated, what comes next?</p>

<h2 id="clarity-of-goals">Clarity of Goals</h2>

<p>One common challenge I’ve confronted when delegating was how unpredictable and uncontrollable the results felt upon handing over the work. This unstructured approach often left me thinking how I could decrease the non-completion risk by diminishing the delegated scope, and created confusion on the delegatee side on how they could proceed.</p>

<p>One tidbit of information from the “Who not How” book provided the guidance and structure to unlock this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(…) research has found that teams who have high levels of autonomy but low clarity goals, as well as little performance feedback, perform worse than teams with low autonomy.</p>

  <p><em>― <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Not-How-Accelerating-Teamwork-ebook/dp/B0867ZJ151">Who not How, by Dan Sullivan with Dr. Benjamin Hardy</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is claimed in the above research that teams which have high autonomy, high goal clarity and regular feedback on their results, were observed to have their performance shooting through the roof.</p>

<p>Apart from regular feedback, goal clarity is incredibly important, and even though it might sound obvious, it can be overlooked and drowned out on the process of delegation.</p>

<h2 id="clarity-in-practice">Clarity, in Practice</h2>

<p>After the above realization, I’ve made it a priority for each piece of delegated work to clearly define what was expected as an outcome, its definition of done, important milestones and deadlines, when should an issue be scaled to me, and which are the ownerships for each of the participants.</p>

<p>All of the above communicated in a clear and concise way, and preferably publicly documented to increase accountability and decrease ambiguity (depending on the situation, merely communicating these verbally might be enough, especially if the task is simple).</p>

<h2 id="the-delegation-formula">The Delegation Formula</h2>

<p>Given the above, the proposed formula for delegation is:</p>

<p><em>Delegation = [ 75/25 rule -&gt; Goal Clarity + Autonomy + Regular Feedback ]</em></p>

<title>Life has several exits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Life has several exits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The exit from your workplace. The last day of work for your employer or your company.</li>
  <li>The exit from that youth group that accompanied you through teenage years and early adulthood.</li>
  <li>The exit from your high-school.</li>
  <li>The exit from your hometown.</li>
  <li>The exit from a long term relationship.</li>
  <li>The exit from life. Your funeral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon your exit, your contributions, actions, decisions, opinions and presence most likely will have affected the trajectories of the people and the world around you, in obvious and less obvious ways. Perhaps your own trajectory was deeply changed as well.</p>

<p>These exits may be celebrated, be a special day with fulfilling words and thoughts. They may be the last time you see a set of people. The last time you will see them in your entire life.</p>

<p>Perhaps upon your final exit, you have made such consequential dents on the world that your name will be engraved into the annals of history for centuries to come. On the other hand, contemporary personalities such Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Warren Buffet might be mostly forgotten a few centuries from now. People will move on, so most likely you should be grateful if your loved ones keep you in their thoughts for those ensuing decades.</p>

<p>Life has several exits. Life is also short and limited. There’ll be a finite number of exits you will experience. Make the most out of each period they enclose.</p>

<title>The real question behind 'what do you want?'</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s easy to want something. If you are fortunate enough to be on <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/income-level-4/">income level 4</a> living in a peaceful nation, the world has so much to offer, within easy reach. Yet, the currencies required to enjoy them are limited: time, energy, health, money. Even though it is easy to make lists of everything one wants (typically occurring on yearly passages, such as new year’s and anniversaries), only a handful of them are achievable.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-lists-require-sacrifices">Smaller lists require sacrifices</h2>
<p>Given that lengthy lists are unachievable, they need to be slimmed down to a manageable and realistic size. They need to be prioritized. <em>Prioritization</em> is an euphemism for <em>sacrificing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to want something, it’s hard to choose it against another desirable one.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>At the start of each year, I produce a small list of 3 to 4 high priority goals and 1 optional low priority goal of what I want to achieve by end of it, along with a small description on why I want them, and their impact. This takes several hours, sometimes days to put together, because of all the other ones that need to be left out.</p>

<p>Once the list is made though, it’s incredibly powerful due to it’s easy recall. This means that whenever I am faced with conflicting preferences, I can easily remember it and know in a snap what is the right thing to do. That is the real power behind that list. It’s guiding all the tiny small steps and decisions happening throughout the year, bringing me progressivily closer to those goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-question">The question</h2>
<p>The real question behind defining <em>knowing what we want</em> is actually <em>what we are willing to sacrifice</em>. Once the latter is defined and we are 100% convinced about it, then <em>knowing what we want</em> is bullet proof and easy to follow through. </p>

<p>What are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

<p>Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT triggered a remarkable societal and computational shift that feels comparable to the impact from the initial internet era with its first impressive search engines like Google. LLMs are the toast of the town.</p>

<p>Writing emails, reports, school homework, analysis, code, summaries. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Save from when you would delegate this task to another fellow human, long hours would be passed in the past trying to conjure a piece of text that could communicate something to another entity. Now this can be made at scale, at low cost, with low effort.</p>

<p>Since we are still liable for the results of this tool, i.e. it’s still our name on the email sender, instead of just sending that email, we might first read that LLM output, interpret it, understand it, and then send it.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-text">More than just text</h2>

<p>Text is a form of communication. If something, or someone wrote it for us, certain decisions were made along the way to convey the goal that we gave. Out of the many paths possible to crystallize that piece of knowledge into a piece text, one of them was chosen.</p>

<p>I would claim that something gets lost on that delegation.</p>

<p>The writing process is more than just the production of text. Many times it requires the exploration of different perspectives, thinking deeply and coming to terms that we don’t know enough about a subject and need to learn more about it.</p>

<p>For example, it’s essential for me to have a notebook at hand to take notes during meetings and formal discussions. I write phrases, loose words, make small diagrams, jot down some reminders. Some of them are never to be re-read again, others I revisit to structure them down into a concise structure. Most of all, they help me think about a problem.</p>

<p>Same holds for notes and articles. I start with a cloud of loosely related ideas, which I attempt to refine into a structured form. Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)">double diamond</a> process.</p>

<p>Same for books. Several times I’ve come to terms that I learned close to nothing about a book read one month before. Or conversations. Or movies. Or experiences.</p>

<p>This is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otazg3TuPWM">except</a> if I reflected or acted about them. Except if I wrote down my conclusions about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, taking notes helps make sure that I’m really thinking hard about what’s in there. If I disagree with the book, sometimes it takes a long time to read the books because I’m writing so much in the margin</p>

<title>Custom Pomodoro Technique</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote>
  <p>Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.</p>

  <p><em>― Theophrastus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are countless articles, books, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4">videos</a> and lectures about time management. Since all of us have different needs, goals and environments, it is best to face them as guidances, where we take the ones we need, and leave the others in our toolbelt for another time.</p>

<p>One of these methodologies is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>, in which a kitchen timer is used to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. </p>

<p>This doesn’t work for me, so here is my <em>Custom Pomodoro Technique</em>.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>I usually need long bouts of deep focus during my work or any complex tasks. This can be reading / writing code, aligning with partners, structuring plans, going through my finances, etc. 25 minutes is typically not enough, since it coincides with where most of my flow peaks happen.</p>

<p>One hour is my target for continuous focused work. Below that, I know that I can still take advantage of the remaining time to productively go through a problem. Above that, I start to prepare to wind down and take a break.</p>

<p>Rule of thumb for breaks are to be enough to feel rested, which tends to happen in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>I’ve tried several tools to track time. Physical and digital. Complex and simple. One has stuck for several years, and is the only one I use right now: <a href="https://www.klokki.com/">Klokki</a></p>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.png" />
           
         </center>

<p>Klokki is a concise Mac application that tracks time and generates nice time reports. It also allows you to track your time automatically, but I don’t use that feature.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful tool that fulfills my main requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to start and stop the timer with a single click.</li>
  <li>The timer should be always visible, but also non-obtrusive.</li>
  <li>Simple usage, with a low UI footprint. No distractions.</li>
  <li>Concise time reports, which allow me to know how much time (and energy) I’ve used throughout the week. This is important for pacing calibration.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The rules</h2>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_on_1_minute.png" />
           
         </center>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever I sit down at the computer and start working, I start the timer. <em>I converged into using a single category to track all my deep flow blocks, since having multiple categories created too much mental overhead</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the timer is on, I’m in productivity / work mode, and no distractions outside my goals are allowed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refrain from stopping the flow session before the one hour mark. Start preparing to stop the flow session after the 1 hour mark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take breaks in-between flow sessions, until I feel rested. Normally less than 15 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the timer is off, scattered tasks, exploration and wandering are allowed and encouraged.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<center>
          
             <source type="image/webp" />
             <source type="image/png" />
             <img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_off.png" />
           
         </center>

<h2 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h2>

<p>This is an incredibly simple methodology that I’ve been using throughout the past years. The recurrent benefits I’ve captured from it were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear boundaries between focus time and exploration.</li>
  <li>Simple, easy to follow process, allowing for flexibility on how time blocks are managed. Easy to consistently abide by.</li>
  <li>Pacing: prevents over-working or under-utilization of my energy / time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to use this guidance / methodology and experiment with it, Or not 🙏</p>

<title>Solving task switching through documentation</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/05/18/solving-task-switching-through-documentation.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/05/18/solving-task-switching-through-documentation.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We don’t actually multitask. We switch-task, rapidly shifting from one thing to another, interrupting ourselves unproductively, and losing time in the process <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It just so happens that many aspects of our life require managing multiple tasks at the same time, so how to approach it?</p>

<p>One strategy that consistently worked for me has been using documentation to checkpoint each step of a process. Just like in a videogame where the last saved checkpoint can be recalled.</p>

<h2 id="the-backtracking-inefficiency">The Backtracking Inefficiency</h2>

<p>Similar to a CPU, our short-term memory (STM) has access to a limited amount (around four or seven concepts have been suggested <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) of very quick memory. Everytime we change to a different task, most of the resident concepts need to be flushed in order to load the ones from the incoming task. This is quite taxing by itself and narrowly optimizable, since our wetware is mostly fixed. The biggest efficiency opportunities lie in <em>where</em> these concepts are loaded from.</p>

<p>When working on a task, often we grab several simultaneous concepts, combine them together and generate new ones, which are then added to the concept pool and built upon further. During this process we are faced with these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Option 1.</strong> Don’t store our working memory - essentially lose work. Let’s rule out this option.</li>
  <li><strong>Option 2.</strong> Progressively store the existing concepts into our long term memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Option 3.</strong> Progressively store the existing concepts into an external memory bank, such as a document or piece of paper.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 2.</strong> works well, but requires significant cognitive effort and often only keeps the most relevant conclusions. If for some reason these need to be re-considered or understood why they were generated in the first place, we backtrack into the seminal thought processes, which in turn will probably require a repetition of previous work.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest offenders when task switching, because even if we recall the end state of a task (which is hard by itself), a lot of time and energy are spent when revisiting the overall context via backtracking.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-as-checkpoint-mechanism">Documentation as Checkpoint Mechanism</h2>

<p>Enter <strong>Option 3.</strong>: <em>Progressively store these existing concepts into an external memory bank, such as a document or piece of paper.</em> Although writing in an external memory bank the contents of our working memory can take some effort, the yielded results greatly justify the initial investment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less cognitive load upon re-starting a task</li>
  <li>Backtracking effort is reduced, since it is a matter of reading a document</li>
  <li>Shareable with other stakeholders, which shaves off the time required to explain these concepts</li>
  <li>Task switching becomes smoother and less burdensome</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The documentation’s structure significantly impacts how efficiently it can be parsed and shared. That is a whole new topic by itself.</li>
  <li>Documentation as a checkpointing mechanism is a great way to consolidate personal learnings and reflections. It’s a valuable tool for leveraging life’s experiences to mature and grow. <em><strong>Option 1.</strong> is such a waste.</em></li>

<title>The case for not having a TV</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/05/04/the-case-for-not-having-tv.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/05/04/the-case-for-not-having-tv.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavidSinclairPodcast">David Sinclair</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab">Andrew Hubberman</a> on how to extend lifespan or improve health markers, and a common trait emerges: the body strives and improves when exposed to just enough stress and struggle. Not too much, though. Cold baths, saunas, fasting, exercise, red light (which disrupts the way that our mitochondria make energy), eating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO8FJ8i02Xo">stressed greens</a>, are examples of just that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you spend your whole day sitting, or typing, always satisfying your hunger, your AMPK and mTOR pathways (which are master regulators of cell metabolism) and sirtuins say: <em>“Hey, times are good. Let’s just grow tissue, go forth, multiply and not build a sustainable body in the long run.”</em></p>

<p>The idolized unhurdled, stable and comfortable life, the easy access to resources and high caloric food, can do more harm than good when left unattended.</p>

<h2 id="the-riveting-third-person">The riveting third person</h2>

<p>I’ve consumed gargantuous amounts of television throughout my youth, so I’ve grown familiar with it’s charming alure. In an almost frictionless experience, where it suffices to lean back and pick one of the channels or series/movies/documentaries readily suggested by a streaming provider, an experience is entered where carefully crafted packages and passionate stories are delivered to us, requiring only our attention. It can even serve as the <em>third-person</em> to liven up the room, when in a tedious moment with a loved one.</p>

<p>No real struggle, no real effort required. A passive experience. The body rejoices in it, like it does when ingesting a sugar packed sweet. Just like most, I enjoy that feeling. Just like most, I have a limited amount of willpower. Hence why I don’t have a TV at home. Neither do I have sweets.</p>

<p>I love it. I don’t love the fact that I’m blocking myself away from those satisfactions. No, I relish the long term results. The time it opens up to actively read, write (this post for example), create, think, be present with others, and even watch podcasts (of which I make an effort to pick an episode outside the normal recommendations). I’m not perfect, and the above serves as a rule for me. And rules do have exceptions, and that’s ok. </p>

<p>Still, this is the case for not having a TV.</p>

<title>The First Note</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/04/07/first-note.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/04/07/first-note.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to <em>Notes</em>!</p>

<p>This is a new space where you will be able to find essays, notes and other quick thoughts, whereas the existing <em>Blog</em> section will remain allocated to denser article pieces.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<h3 id="the-recurrent-idea">The Recurrent Idea</h3>

<p>I have a rule when buying non-essential items for my house: if I’ve been recurrently thinking about buying something over a span of multiple days, then it’s a good purchasing signal. The thought process for writing articles for this blog is similar.</p>

<p>The downside of this approach is that the ideas and thoughts that don’t make it to a blog article are relegated into the realm of personal writings and/or conversations with others, but never exposed to the public. On the other hand, this very same thirst to share quick thoughts was recurrent by itself.</p>

<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>

<p>The yearning towards developing this concept was there, but a satisfactory hosting plaform was missing still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter: although it allowed for volume and looser thoughts, the character restriction would limit the exploration of a topic, and all the content would not be owned by me.</li>
  <li>New self-hosted space: this allowed me to own the contents and have a clear separation between dense blog articles and quick thoughts, but the maintenance cost was prohibitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third option was to host them here, in <em>Byte Tank</em>, which was customized over several years and already had the workflow and components I strived for. But how to frame this new concept into the existing structure?</p>

<p>The answer came from <a href="https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/How%20I%20write%20this%20blog%20on%20my%20iPhone%20in%20a%20train">Alin Panaitiu</a>. On his website, Alin has a separate section for <em>Notes</em>, which makes perfect sense to me. <em>Notes</em> sets the expectation that they are not fully fledged articles, and that they cater towards volume, rather than density.</p>

<h3 id="making-it-a-reality">Making it a reality</h3>

<p>An idea is only worth for its implementation, and these were the last nudges that incentivized me to bring it to life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inspiring examples presented in several of the comments in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35164819">Ask HN: What has your personal website/blog done for you?</a>. One of them being a reference to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/">Why and how to write things on the Internet</a>, the other one being Alin’s website (see above).</li>
  <li>The spirit of the earlier Internet. I remember the earlier times of the Internet where there was this widespread fascination with the fact that with a telephone connection, one could have access to its immense world, and had the possibility to create their own virtual home, that anyone could visit. That is one of the many beauties of this massive network. Low cost, virtually no gatekeepers, nearly boundless. I find this idea incredibly exciting and empowering.</li>
  <li>Even in an era where text content is now produced for a low cost and in massive amounts (GPT and other LLMs), I believe there is still space for <em>artisanal</em> human baked opinions. The human relatableness, its connection with the environment, biology and even its limitations are still charming on their own.</li>
  <li>The incentive to create notes in volume could be a great way to generate more source material that can be coalesced into new blog articles</li>
  <li>Exposing looser thoughts publicly forces me to structure then, and I believe this process can make me better equipped to navigate the complex universe of human interactions, in which having a more structured mindset can make a world of a difference. Personally and professionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>

<p>This is an exciting new phase for this modest establishment, and I’m looking forward to populating this section with new content. Until then!</p>

  <li>By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—for nothing in particular.

  <li>The biggest battle I have is restricting their video game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to read more than they play video games. They also can’t play completely stupid video games. There’s one game they downloaded recently called Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It’s like a Psych 101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play Flappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>

  <li>On describes the earliest startup as like driving a race car. You’re close to the ground, and you feel every move you make. You have control, you can turn quickly, you feel like things are moving fast. Of course, you’re also at risk of crashing at any moment, but you only take yourself down if you do. As you grow, you graduate to a commercial flight. You’re farther from the ground, and more people’s lives depend on you, so you need to consider your movements more carefully, but you still feel in control and can turn the plane relatively quickly. Finally, you graduate to a spaceship, where you can’t make quick moves and the course is set long in advance, but you’re capable of going very far and taking tons of people along for the ride. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Most of the people at PayPal don’t understand this. The reason it worked was because the cost of transactions in PayPal was lower than any other system. And the reason the cost of transactions was lower is because we were able to do an increasing percentage of our transactions as ACH, or automated clearinghouse, electronic transactions, and most importantly, internal transactions. Internal transactions were essentially fraud-free and cost us nothing. An ACH transaction costs, I don’t know, like twenty cents or something. But it was slow, so that was the bad thing. It’s dependent on the bank’s batch processing time. And then the credit card transaction was fast, but expensive in terms of the credit card processing fees and very prone to fraud. That’s the problem Square is having now. “Square is doing the wrong version of PayPal. The critical thing is to achieve internal transactions. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>

  <li>Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Are production incidents happening that are taking up lots of time? Are a bunch of people sick? Are they bickering over coding style in their code review comments? Are the tickets that are being written vague, too big, too small? Does the team seem upbeat in their communication style, sharing fun things as well as important work in chat, or are they purely business? Look at their calendars. Is the team spending many hours a week in meetings? Is their manager not doing 1-1s? None of these things are necessarily smoking guns, but they may point to an area to address. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Conway’s Law is often cited in discussions of this kind of structure.

  <li>As ridiculous and dangerous as this might seem, plenty of teams fall prey to the lure of status. These often include altruistic nonprofit organizations that come to believe that the nobility of their mission is enough to justify their satisfaction. Political groups, academic departments, and prestigious companies are also susceptible to this dysfunction, as they often see success in merely being associated with their special organizations. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>

  <li>Forget “minimum viable products”—ever since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others’ successes. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Because let’s face it: Goals are fake. Nearly all of them are artificial targets set for the sake of setting targets. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>Start with a shared understanding of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision. When you assign the ownership for making a <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>

  <li>You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s likely that Q1 (immediately after the winter holidays) will be the most productive and Q4 (the quarter that includes winter and the end-of-year holidays) will be the least productive. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Therefore, you must always be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don’t ask, especially if you believe that the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks. This means you must be aggressive about getting estimates, and as we all know, software estimation is a very difficult process. Negotiating the process that your team uses to estimate, on what timescale, for what projects, may be part of your job at this level. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>If you haven’t taken the time to articulate the value of this work, it will get pushed aside in favor of projects that are more clearly valuable. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>My advice is to do your best to gather data to support yourself, and talk about what will be possible when the work is done. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>When an engineer comes to you with an engineering project that she wants to do, think about framing the project by answering these questions: How big is that project? How important is it? Can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks? What would successful completion of the project mean for the team? <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>The hardest part, in many ways, was getting started. The second-hardest part was getting comfortable making a guess about the future with highly imperfect information. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“The key, of course, is to define our goals, our results, in a way that is simple enough to grasp easily, and specific enough to be actionable. Profit is not actionable enough.

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The most important lesson I’ve learned is that you have to be able to manage yourself if you want to be good at managing others. The more time you spend understanding yourself, the way you react, the things that inspire you, and the things that drive you crazy, the better off you will be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Contrary to the notion that teams waste time and energy arguing, those that avoid conflict actually doom themselves to revisiting issues again and again without resolution. They often ask team members to take their issues “off-line,” which seems to be a euphemism for avoiding dealing with an important topic, only to have it raised again at the next meeting. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>Great teams ensure that everyone’s ideas are genuinely considered, which then creates a willingness to rally around whatever decision is ultimately made by the group. And when that is not possible due to an impasse, the leader of the team is allowed to make the call. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) dysfunctional teams that try to hedge their bets and delay important decisions until they have enough data to feel certain that they are making the right decision. As prudent as this might seem, it is dangerous because of the paralysis and lack of confidence it breeds within a team. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>More than any other member of the team, the leader must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that ultimately turns out to be wrong. And the leader must be constantly pushing the group for closure around issues, as well as adherence to schedules that the team has set. What the leader cannot do is place too high a premium on certainty or consensus. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) the most effective and efficient means of maintaining high standards of performance on a team is peer pressure. One of the benefits is the reduction of the need for excessive bureaucracy around performance management and corrective action. More than any policy or system, there is nothing like the fear of letting down respected teammates that motivates people to improve their performance. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>If the boss really wants to know what’s going on, the answer is embarrassingly obvious: They have to ask! Not vague, self-congratulatory bullshit questions like “What can we do even better?” but the hard ones like “What’s something nobody dares to talk about?” or “Are you afraid of anything at work?” or “Is there anything you worked on recently that you wish you could do over?” Or even more specific ones like “What do you think we could have done differently to help Jane succeed?” or “What advice would you give before we start on the big website redesign project?” <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>A lack of engagement in meetings tends to mean the team isn’t engaged by the work or do not feel like they have a say in the decision-making process. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>But there is such a thing as artificial harmony, and conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>The goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less effectively together and resolve them, not to become the team’s therapist. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice — that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. It’s awkward, and uncomfortable, but it’s also part of your job as his manager to have these difficult conversations. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Thinking about your actions is the best way to combat fear of conflict. Am I pushing this decision to the team because they really are the best people to decide, or am I just afraid that if I make an unpopular but necessary decision people will be mad at me? Am I avoiding working through this issue with my peer because she’s truly difficult to work with, or am I just hoping that the issue will resolve itself because I don’t want to have to discuss it and possibly be wrong? Am I holding back on giving my employee this feedback because he really was having a bad day and it’s just a one-off, or am I holding back because I’m afraid he won’t like me as a manager if I tell him? Be thoughtful about your behavior, and it’s unlikely that you’ll seek out unnecessary conflict. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>The real goal here is psychological safety — that is, a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Your first goal is to protect your team as a whole, the second is to protect each individual on the team, and your last priority is protecting yourself. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Simply put, if your team member doesn’t respect you or her peers, why is she working there? <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>So at the end of another day when I feel like I didn’t write enough code and I have no way to quantify what I’ve achieved, I tell myself I was being as good a manager as I know how to be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Project management. Onboarding new team members. Working with the product team to break down product roadmap goals into technical deliverables. Production support. These are all skills members of your team need to learn. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Even when you have been hired to fix a team, remember that the company has gotten this far because of some fundamental strengths. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Whether it’s QA, design, product management, or technical operations, ask lots of questions, but in an open way. Make it clear to the person that your goal is to understand what she does so that you’re capable of appreciating it better. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Sit in their meetings. Are they boring to you? Is the team bored? Who is speaking most of the time? Are there regular meetings with the whole team where the vast majority of the time is spent listening to the manager or product lead talk? Boring meetings are a sign. They may be a sign of inefficient planning on the part of the organizers. There may be too many meetings happening for the information covered. They may indicate that the team members don’t feel they can actually help set the direction of the team, or choose the work that will happen. They often signal a lack of healthy conflict on a team. Good meetings have a heavy discussion element, where opinions and ideas are drawn out of the team. If the meetings are overscripted, so that no real conversation can take place, it stifles that creative discussion. If people are afraid to disagree or bring up issues for fear of dealing with conflict, or if managers always shut down conflict without letting disagreements air, this is a sign of an unhealthy team culture. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>A bunch of people who never talk to each other and are always working on independent projects are not really working as a team. There would be nothing wrong with that if the team were performing well, but given that they’re not, this may be contributing to your problem. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Projects change. Teams may even be disbanded or moved around in ways that you don’t understand or agree with. As a manager, the best thing you can do is help people feel capable of tying up loose ends, stabilizing the current in-flight projects, and easing into their new work in a controlled fashion. This is an area where you can and should push back. Make sure that your teams get adequate time to finish up current work. Furthermore, push for engineering involvement in the early planning for the new work so that people can get excited about the projects they are moving on to. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s not about being the lead engineer, chasing the latest language or framework, or having the shiniest technology. It’s about building a team with the tools and attributes to build the best possible product for our customers. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>You can’t give up the responsibility of management without giving up the power that comes with it. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Reach through the part of you that is shy about praising people or embarrassed to share your feelings, and go into the part of you that cares about the people you work with.

  <li>(…) the larger the company, the smaller the team should be at the top. And with the addition of a new head of sales and a human resources director, her staff had grown to a barely manageable eight. It wasn’t that Kathryn couldn’t handle the weekly one-on-ones, but it was increasingly difficult to have fluid and substantive discussions during staff meetings with nine people sitting around the table. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) trust is the confidence among team members that their peers’ intentions are good, and that there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group. (…) Teams that lack trust waste inordinate amounts of time and energy managing their behaviors and interactions within the group. They tend to dread team meetings, and are reluctant to take risks in asking for or offering assistance to others. As a result, morale on distrusting teams is usually quite low, and unwanted turnover is high. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initially the technologists and the hippies did not interface well. Many in the counterculture saw computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of the Pentagon and the power structure. In The Myth of the Machine, the historian Lewis Mumford warned that computers were sucking away our freedom and destroying “life-enhancing values.” An injunction on punch cards of the period—“Do not fold, spindle or mutilate”—became an ironic phrase of the antiwar Left. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Engineers frequently struggle with the transition to respecting and communicating well with diverse peers. I believe the struggle with respect is a side effect of the current tech culture, which tells us that engineers are the smartest people in the room. It can’t be said strongly enough: your peers who are not analytically driven are not stupid. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Engineers who graduated from MIT” is not a culture. “People who value technology innovation, hard work, intellect, scientific process, and data” might be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>A lot of interviews try to determine cultural fit by what I would call “friendship” markers, such as “Would you like being stuck in an airport with this person?” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Furthermore, culture fit as determined by friendship tests is almost certain to be discriminatory in some way. Humans form friendships with people who have significant shared background experiences, and these experiences tend to closely correlate with things like schooling, race, class, and gender. The shortcuts you get by hiring friends are not usually the values you need to form a strong team. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="systems--processes">Systems / Processes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>As your teams and systems grow, it’s almost impossible for any one person to keep the systems in her head. Because we have a bunch of people coordinating work, we evolve processes around that work coordination in order to make risks obvious. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) you should not put a complicated process on any activity where you want people to move quickly and where you believe the risk for change in that activity is low or that the risks themselves are obvious to the whole team. If you want to do code review for all changes, make sure that the process for code review is not so onerous that the team slows down significantly on minor changes, because that will impact your whole group’s productivity. The second implication is that you need to be on the lookout for places where there is hidden risk, and draw those hidden risks out into the open. There’s a saying in politics that “a good political idea is one that works well in half-baked form,” and the same goes for engineering processes. The processes should have value even when they are not followed perfectly, and that value should largely lie in the act of socializing change or risk to the team as a whole. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Be specific about the kinds of changes that need architecture review. Usually these include new languages, new frameworks, new storage systems, and new developer tooling. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>

  <li>But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister’s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision.

  <li>It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for “realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise \$1,000,000 than it is \$100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s. If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself.

  <li>It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one’s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100.

  <li>When you want to allow for group decision making, the group needs to have a clear set of standards that they use to evaluate decisions. Start with a shared understanding of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision.

  <li>I define masculinity as that part of a man that equips him to survive as an individual, clan, and species. Without this masculine energy we would have all become extinct eons ago.

  <li>This frustration is due to the reality that in general, women view men who try to please them as weak and hold these men in contempt.

  <li>Internalized shame and fear are the greatest barriers to a satisfying sex life.

All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, ‘How strong I am now and how secure,’ and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self‐destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself.

  <li>Ideological conflict is limited to concepts and ideas, and avoids personality-focused, mean-spirited attacks. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.

  <li>And what follows from this right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="history--evolution">History / Evolution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>It is unsettling – and perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex with an animal from a different species, and produce children together. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="religion--spirituality">Religion / Spirituality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“I think different religions are different doors to the same house. Sometimes I think the house exists, and sometimes I don’t. It’s the great mystery.” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>For even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>Freedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: “Yes, you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you, save us from ourselves!” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“Every morning at six A.M., the first thing to hit my desk was this overnight report that included information on who got killed and what killed them,” O’Connell said. “I kept thinking, This is insane. Why are we in this place? It was not just Iraq but the whole picture. Why were we so invested in that part of the world?” The unsurprising answer that O’Connell came up with was oil. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In Cowen’s future, huge gains in artificial intelligence will lead to the elimination of many of today’s high-employment lines of work. The people who thrive in this environment will be very bright and able to complement the machines and team effectively with them. As for the unemployed masses? Well, many of them will eventually find jobs going to work for the Haves, who will employ teams of nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners. If anything Musk is doing might alter the course of mankind toward a rosier future, Cowen can’t find it. Coming up with true breakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to Cowen, because we’ve already mined the bulk of the big discoveries. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>If not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan for a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your working lifetime of 40–50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid work. How many do you have to go? It’s probably time to cut your losses. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="off-the-cuff">Off the Cuff</h2>
<ul>
  <li>(Musk nearly died on a trip to Africa, where he caught a type of severe malaria. It was discovered late on his return to the United States, and Musk spent 10 agonizing days in intensive care. It took him six months to recover and lost 20 kilos during the illness.) “I came very close to dying,” Musk said. “That’s my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.” <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>“The guy comes in, and Elon asks him why they’re meeting,” Spikes said. “He said, ‘To develop a relationship.’ Elon replied, ‘Okay.

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is growth. You grow or you die.</p>

  <p><em>― Phil Knight, Shoe Dog</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve had the good fortune of having the opportunity to develop my software engineering work as a tech lead (which is not a fixed role), focusing more of my effort on solving sets of problems, as opposed to individual projects/tasks. While navigating this path, I’ve gathered a set of teachings from my mentors/peers/managers and other personal learnings and observations that I attempted to compile in a condensed list. Hopefully these can be useful in your own journey, just like other people’s learnings were to mine:</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li><strong>Planning</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear planning and prioritization of your projects is essential</strong>, especially in the early phases of an initiative. Well defined projects, with solid goaling metrics and well defined ownerships for each project, go a long way towards setting them up for success. These reduce the risk of not meeting goals, and allow for everyone involved to know which areas they need to tackle and own. Another interesting side effect is the value proposition to prospecting new-comers to support your projects, since there is a clear definition of what they can own and how valuable their contribution will be to the team/organization.</li>
      <li><strong>But don’t plan too much</strong> - healthy balance is the secret: if your organization is fast moving and dynamic, excessive planning can have the deleterious effect that <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/11647520">little execution is actually done</a>, since most of the time is spent planning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Design Docs, Strategy and Vision</strong>: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design Docs</strong> are a valuable vehicle to crystalize how a complex system or process can be implemented, they incentivize the owner to structure their thoughts, are made stronger by receiving feedback from peers, and serve as an exceptional piece of documentation that will not only explain how a given system/process works, but also serve a rationale on why they were built that way. Here is an <a href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/">example template from Google</a></li>
      <li><strong>Strategy and Vision</strong> - <em>This reflection will be mostly based on this great <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/engineering-strategy">StaffEng article</a>, which I vividly recommend.</em> If you realize that you’ve rehashed the same discussion three or four times, look into your organization’s objectives, find the commonalities from five of your organization’s design docs, combine all of these together, and you have material to write a strategy. When the future’s too hazy to identify investments worth making, grab five strategies, combine them with your organization’s objectives and write a vision for two to three years out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Scaling oneself</strong>: The best way to increase impact is by scaling oneself. I’ve personally encountered my speed limit when trying to solve a critical-path project, while at the same attempting to set the direction for the team. As much as I worked, placed hours, or made the process effective, I was the bottleneck. I’ve hit a speed limit, and at the time it was made clear by my manager that in order to increase impact, unblock our team, achieve our objectives and have a balanced workload, I would need to scale myself.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scaling through Delegation - the 75/25 rule</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>If you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors and innovate. In other words, grow.</li>
          <li>If you are 100% certain that the delegatee will successfully achieve a given project/task, they will not grow. On the other hand, if the probability of success is too low, then the project/task will be frustrating, probably will not be completed, and will jeopardize the team’s objectives.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>By default, don’t micromanage</strong>: 
        <ul>
          <li>When delegating a task/project, give enough space for the delegatee to own it. In general, the objective is to clearly define expectations, clearly define areas of ownership, and agree upon which details you should be kept up to date, which meetings you should attend, and in which situations you would expect to be pinged for escalations.</li>
          <li>Micromanaging only makes sense in very specific situations, such as when there is a high possibility of a major failure and help is needed to firefight and course correct.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If you are not failing, you’re not pushing hard enough. And probably not growing</strong>: Conversely, the 75/25 rule can be applied to oneself. If you find you are easily executing your projects with a high level of predictability, this provides a hint that you should look for bigger challenges and responsibilities. In other words, aim for a growth mindset, rather than a fixed mindset.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Errors</strong>: Making errors is completely OK and expected. They are part of the ~25% above. Strive for them to happen only once, otherwise they will fail to serve their learning purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mentorship</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Give: one of the best ways to learn how to support projects is to mentor a new joiner.</strong> This will give you the opportunity to develop your interpersonal and project managing skills as you support/scope/prioritize projects and tasks for your mentee, and will help you consolidate your knowledge about the team and its position in the company as you transmit this knowledge forward. This relationship is especially rewarding in the long term as you work together on other projects down the line.</li>
      <li><strong>Receive: having good mentors is one of the best ways to quickly grow and learn.</strong> I have had the good fortune to learn from specially good mentors throughout my tenure, who apart from sharing their deep technical knowledge about our systems and processes, provided me solid foundations (either directly or by example) on how to navigate ambiguity and tackle challenging projects/situations. Every new mentor will have something novel to share and teach to you, it is an ongoing process. Good mentors provide you a golden path that you can follow to cut through the exhausting search for viable solutions to a given problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Learn from others</strong>: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outside your organization</strong>: other people’s experiences are immensely helpful, specially the ones that have been time tested and are well structured. Books are a good source of this knowledge, and I would recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a>, from which I extracted many of my base understandings of what a techlead should be, do and behave. The book goes straight to the point, gives actionable examples and was written by a very experienced manager.</li>
      <li><strong>Reach out to your peers</strong>: specially in the beginning of my role as techlead, I was struggling to find the right balance between personal impact from my own actions and (the less concrete) directional impact. To resolve my conundrum, I’ve reached out for support from my manager, my original mentor and a fellow experienced techlead. Their experiences and advices helped me to tackle this subject, and other challenges that came along the way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Measure your success</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goaling against quantifiable metrics = solid prioritization and justification</strong>: Make sure that all your projects are goaled against an objective, quantifiable metric. Otherwise it will be hard to prioritize between them and justify their value during planning and execution to your peers and external stakeholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear and quantifiable goals = increased motivation</strong>: Projects with goals based on solid metrics allow for anyone working on a project to know how valuable their contribution will be. I would claim that working on projects with an ambiguous value proposition is frustrating and will receive less attention and effort from everyone involved, since it will not be clear how impactful their actions will be.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure your personal progress by asking for candid feedback</strong>: if your manager and/peers don’t give you candid feedback on your progress, ask for it explicitly. It is one of the best ways to measure your progress on your role and surfacing any blindspots.</li>
      <li><strong>No measurement = flying blind</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Communication - what you transmit, and how, matters</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Written and oral communication is essential when explaining the rationale behind an objective/project/task, and when coordinating with your peers and other stakeholders. This is a skill that can be learned, and one that I am still actively evolving. The best way to improve it, as I have found, is to write more, speak more, make more presentations, and study the communication methods from others.</li>
      <li>As a rule of thumb, most communication styles benefit from a “news article” structure: first a TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read), then an overall context of the problem in question and its impact, followed by details such as the delineation of a set of solutions, ending with a call to action or further questions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Imposter syndrome</strong>: this might stem from a mismatch between your perceived performance and expectations for your role. Work with your manager to explicitly define expectations. Ask your manager and peers for explicit feedback, so you can better calibrate your perceptions. If you feel like an imposter, odds are, <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/actual-impostors-dont-get-impostor-syndrome/">you aren’t</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Take care of your body and mind, they are your ultimate tools</strong>: Last but not least, exercise, eat healthy food, nourish your relationships and strive for quality sleep. These are the essential tenants for the infrastructure (you) that will sustain all of the above points.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>Hacker News is my go-to source for relevant, interesting and constructive discussions on a wide range of topics. I usually consume it via <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Daemonology’s Hacker News Daily</a>, to catch up on the most active topics in the community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Daemonology’s Hacker News Daily</a> presents the title, story link, Hacker News discussion link, and is optimized for desktop. I usually consult it on mobile, and when I am several days behind, I sweep through the archives and open several story/discussion links in separate mobile tabs, in order to triage the stories with a quick glance at their web page and their discussion’s top comments.</p>

<p>This project aims to ease that process, by generating a set of web pages presenting the best daily Hacker News for mobile or desktop, with screenshots and top comments for each story, while aiming to have a low footprint to the end user.</p>

<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/hackernews_daily/hn_daily_diagram.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/hackernews_daily/hn_daily_diagram.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Information flow diagram between the different components of the system </figcaption></figure>

<p>The basilar idea is to recurrently get the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">best Hacker News</a> stories via its <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a>; take screenshots of the web pages that these stories link to; and have this workflow executed via <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>

<p>In specific, these are the steps taken to generate the final web pages (illustrated by the above diagram):</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Every day, a new <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/hackernews_daily/actions">Github Workflow</a> is spawned, kickstarting the entire process.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Update History</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first step is to get the past days best stories from the last successful run, and add the current best stories by
 reaching out to the Hacker News API to fetch the current list of best stories, removing the ones that were already featured, and adding the top ones to the current history
    <ul>
      <li>To persist the past best stories history, an <code>days_history.dat</code> artifact is created in every run, which is a simple <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html">Python Pickle</a> containing the story ids from the past days. These days are stored in form of a deque, in order to pop the older days as the history grows larger</li>
      <li>The final result of this step is a new <code>days_history.dat</code>, which will be used in the next step below, and will also serve as a base for the next workflow</li>
      <li>If a viable <code>days_history.dat</code> artifact cannot not be found in the previous successful runs, it is rebuilt by parsing the <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Daemonology’s Hacker News Daily</a> web page</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Create Day/Story Models</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the story ids provided by the previously built <code>days_history.dat</code>, a list of hydrated days with their respective stories are built. These models will posteriorly provide all the information needed to create the final web page views
    <ul>
      <li>Each story is composed of an ID, title, story link, Hacker News discussion link, and its top comments. This information is obtained via the Hacker News API (example <a href="https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/25518730.json?print=pretty">call</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Create the <code>generated</code> folder. This is where the generated web pages and screenshots will be placed, in order to be later deployed to GitHub pages</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Gather Screenshots</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/">pyppeteer</a>, an headless browser is created to navigate through all the story links
    <ul>
      <li>A screenshot is taken for each of these pages (after attempting to dismiss a possible “Allow Cookies” prompt), and stored as PNGs in the <code>generated</code> folder</li>
      <li>Each of these screenshots are re-encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WebP</a>, which allows for a smaller image footprint in browser’s that support it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If there is an unexpected error while processing the screenshots, it will not halt the overall workflow, since the final web pages can still function without screenshot images</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6</strong>. Generate Web Pages</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/">Jinja</a>, a templating engine for Python, is used to define and generate each of the final web pages. Four web pages are generated from a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/hackernews_daily/blob/main/templates/page.html">single template</a>. These four variants are permutations of either presenting all past 10 days or not, and either showing images or not:
    <ul>
      <li>Latest day, with images</li>
      <li>Latest day, without images</li>
      <li>Past 10 days, with images</li>
      <li>Past 10 days, without images</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It was chosen to keep these in separate static web pages, in order to keep them simple, static, and without additional dynamic logic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7.</strong> The <code>generated</code> folder is deployed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, which is deployed as a GitHub page, making these generated contents <a href="https://lopespm.github.io/hackernews_daily">publicly accessible</a></p>

<title>Implementation: Autocomplete System Design for Large Scale</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This article will go through my implementation/design of a large scale autocomplete/typeahead suggestions system design, like the suggestions one gets when typing a Google search.</p>

<p>This design was implemented using Docker Compose<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:10" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and you can find the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/autocomplete">https://github.com/lopespm/autocomplete</a></p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<p>The design has to accommodate a Google-like scale of about 5 billion daily searches, which translates to about 58 thousand queries per second. We can expect 20% of these searches to be unique, this is, 1 billion queries per day.</p>

<p>If we choose to index 1 billion queries, with 15 characters on average per query<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:12" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and 2 bytes per character (we will only support the english locale), then we will need about 30GB of storage to host these queries.</p>

<h2 id="functional-requirements">Functional Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Get a list of top phrase suggestions based on the user input (a prefix)</li>
  <li>Suggestions ordered by weighting the frequency and recency of a given phrase/query<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:11" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The main two APIs will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>top-phrases(prefix)</em>: returns the list of top phrases for a given prefix</li>
  <li><em>collect-phrase(phrase)</em>: submits the searched phrase to the system. This phrase will later be used by the assembler to build a data structure which maps a prefix to a list of top phrases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-functional-requirements">Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Highly Available</em></li>
  <li><em>Performant</em> - response time for the top phrases should be quicker than the user’s type speed (&lt; 200ms)</li>
  <li><em>Scalable</em> - the system should accommodate a large number of requests, while still maintaining its performance</li>
  <li><em>Durable</em> - previously searched phrases (for a given timespan) should be available, even if there is a hardware fault or crash</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>The two main sub-systems are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>the distributor, which handles the user’s requests for the top phrases of a given prefix</li>
  <li>the assembler, which collects user searches and assembles them into a data structure that will later be used by the distributor</li>
</ul>

<p>This implementation uses off-the-shelf components like kafka (message broker), hadoop (map reduce and distributed file system), redis (distributed cache) and nginx (load balancing, gateway, reverse proxy), but also has custom services built in python, namely the trie distribution and building services. The trie data structure is custom made as well.</p>

<p>The backend services in this implementation are built to be self sustainable and don’t require much orchestration. For example, if an active backend host stops responding, it’s corresponding ephemeral znode registry eventually disappears, and another standby backend node takes its place by attempting to claim the position via an <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes">ephemeral</a> <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Sequence+Nodes+--+Unique+Naming">sequential</a> znode on zookeeper.</p>

<h3 id="trie-the-bedrock-data-structure">Trie: the bedrock data structure</h3>

<p>The data structure used by, and provided to the distributor is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a>, with each of its prefix nodes having a list of top phrases. The top phrases are referenced using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern">flyweight pattern</a>, meaning that the string literal of a phrase is stored only once. Each prefix node has a list of top phrases, which are a list of references to string literals.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen before, we will need about 30GB to index 1 billion queries, which is about the memory we would need for the above mentioned trie to store 1 billion queries. Since we want to keep the trie in memory to enable fast lookup times for a given query, we are going to partition the trie into multiple tries, each one on a different machine. This relieves the memory load on any given machine.</p>

<p>For increased availability, the services hosting these tries will also have multiple replicas. For increased durability, the serialized version of the tries will be available in a distributed file system (HDFS), and these can be rebuilt via map reduce tasks in a predictable, deterministic way.</p>

<h2 id="information-flow">Information Flow</h2>

<h3 id="assembler-collect-data-and-assemble-the-tries">Assembler: collect data and assemble the tries</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Client submits the searched phrase to the gateway via <code>http://localhost:80/search?phrase="a user query"</code></li>
  <li>Since the search service is outside the scope of this implementation, the gateway directly sends the searched phrase to the collector’s load balancer via <code>http://assembler.collector-load-balancer:6000/collect-phrase?phrase="a user query"</code></li>
  <li>The collector’s load balancer forwards the request to one of the collector backends via <code>http://assembler.collector:7000/collect-phrase?phrase="a user query"</code></li>
  <li>The collector backend sends a message to the <em>phrases</em> topic to the message broker (kafka). The key and value are the phrase itself <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>The Kafka Connect HDFS Connector <code>assembler.kafka-connect</code> dumps the messages from the <em>phrases</em> topic into the <code>/phrases/1_sink/phrases/{30 minute window timestamp}</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> folder <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li>
  <li>Map Reduce jobs are triggered <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:4" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>: they will reduce the searched phrases into a single HDFS file, by weighting the recency and frequency of each phrase <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>A <code>TARGET_ID</code> is generated, according to the current time, for example <code>TARGET_ID=20200807_1517</code></li>
      <li>The first map reduce job is executed for the <em>K</em> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:6" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> most recent <code>/phrases/1_sink/phrases/{30 minute window timestamp}</code> folders, and attributes a base weight for each of these (the more recent, the higher the base weight). This job will also sum up the weights for the same phrase in a given folder. The resulting files will be stored in the <code>/phrases/2_with_weight/2_with_weight/{TARGET_ID}</code> HDFS folder</li>
      <li>The second map reduce job will sum up all the weights of a given phrase from <code>/phrases/2_with_weight/2_with_weight/{TARGET_ID}</code> into <code>/phrases/3_with_weight_merged/{TARGET_ID}</code></li>
      <li>The third map reduce job will order the entries by descending weight, and pass them through a single reducer, in order to produce a single file. This file is placed in <code>/phrases/4_with_weight_ordered/{TARGET_ID}</code></li>
      <li>The zookeper znode <code>/phrases/assembler/last_built_target</code> is set to the <code>TARGET_ID</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The Trie Builder service, which was listening to changes in the <code>/phrases/assembler/last_built_target</code> znode, builds a trie for each partition<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:7" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>, based on the <code>/phrases/4_with_weight_ordered/{TARGET_ID}</code> file. For example, one trie may cover the prefixes until <em>mod</em>, another from <em>mod</em> to <em>racke</em>, and another from <em>racke</em> onwards.
    <ol>
      <li>Each trie is serialized and written into the <code>/phrases/5_tries/{TARGET_ID}/{PARTITION}</code> HDFS file (e.g. <code>/phrases/5_tries/20200807_1517/mod\|racke</code>), and the zookeeper znode <code>/phrases/distributor/{TARGET_ID}/partitions/{PARTITION}/trie_data_hdfs_path</code> is set to the previously mentioned HDFS file path.</li>
      <li>The service sets the zookeper znode <code>/phrases/distributor/next_target</code> to the <code>TARGET_ID</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="transfering-the-tries-to-the-distributor-sub-system">Transfering the tries to the Distributor sub-system</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The distributor backend nodes can either be in active mode (serving requests) or standby mode. The nodes in standby mode will fetch the most recent tries, load them into memory, and mark themselves as ready to take over the active position. In detail:
    <ol>
      <li>The standby nodes, while listening to changes to the znode <code>/phrases/distributor/next_target</code>, detect its modification and create an <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes">ephemeral</a> <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Sequence+Nodes+--+Unique+Naming">sequential</a> znode, for each partition, one at a time, inside the <code>/phrases/distributor/{TARGET_ID}/partitions/{PARTITION}/nodes/</code> znode. If the created znode is one of the first R znodes (R being the number of replica nodes per partition <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:8" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>), proceed to the next step. Otherwise, remove the znode from this partition and try to join the next partition.</li>
      <li>The standby backend node fetches the serialized trie file from <code>/phrases/5_tries/{TARGET_ID}/{PARTITION}</code>, and starts loading the trie into memory.</li>
      <li>When the trie is loaded into memory, the standby backend node marks itself as ready by setting the <code>/phrases/distributor/{TARGET_ID}/partitions/{PARTITION}/nodes/{CREATED_ZNODE}</code> znode to the backend’s hostname.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The Trie Backend Applier service polls the <code>/phrases/distributor/{TARGET_ID}/</code> sub-znodes (the <code>TARGET_ID</code> is the one defined in <code>/phrases/distributor/next_target</code>), and checks if all the nodes in all partitions are marked as ready
    <ol>
      <li>If all of them are ready for this next <code>TARGET_ID</code>, the service, in a single transaction, changes the value of the <code>/phrases/distributor/next_target</code> znode to empty, and sets the <code>/phrases/distributor/current_target</code> znode to the new <code>TARGET_ID</code>. With this single step, all of the standby backend nodes which were marked as ready will now be active, and will be used for the following Distributor requests.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="distributor-handling-the-requests-for-top-phrases">Distributor: handling the requests for Top Phrases</h3>

<p>With the distributor’s backend nodes active and loaded with their respective tries, we can start serving top phrases requests for a given prefix:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Client requests the gateway for the top phrases for a given prefix via <code>http://localhost:80/top-phrases?prefix="some prefix"</code></li>
  <li>The gateway sends this request to the distributor’s load balancer via <code>http://distributor.load-balancer:5000/top-phrases?prefix="some prefix"</code></li>
  <li>The load balancer forwards the request to one of the frontends via <code>http://distributor.frontend:8000/top-phrases?prefix="some prefix"</code></li>
  <li>The frontend service handles the request:
    <ol>
      <li>The frontend service checks if the distributed cache (redis) has an entry for this prefix <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:9" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. If it does, return these cached top phrases. Otherwise, continue to next step</li>
      <li>The frontend service gets the partitions for the current <code>TARGET_ID</code> from zookeeper (<code>/phrases/distributor/{TARGET_ID}/partitions/</code> znode), and picks the one that matches the provided prefix</li>
      <li>The frontend service chooses a random znode from the <code>/phrases/distributor/{TARGET_ID}/partitions/{PARTITION}/nodes/</code> znode, and gets its hostname</li>
      <li>The frontend service requests the top phrases, for the given prefix, from the selected backend via <code>http://{BACKEND_HOSTNAME}:8001/top-phrases="some prefix"</code>
        <ol>
          <li>The backend returns the list of top phrases for the given prefix, using its corresponding loaded trie</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The frontend service inserts the list of top phrases into the distributed cache (cache aside pattern), and returns the top phrases</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The top phrases response bubbles up to the client</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="prototype">Prototype</h1>

<p>About six years ago I started learning Unity in my spare time, going through several official and unofficial tutorials. One was a simple tutorial on how to create a wire chain through physics. After its completion, I added a simple platform and a sphere. When arrow keys were pressed the sphere was torqued, and on spacebar press a vertical force was added to sphere, which caused it to jump. I was at awe. Unity’s physics were accessible and felt natural out of the box. Not only that, but a rough working scene could be quickly setup by gluing some basic concepts.</p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Wire chain and sphere physics</p>

<p>An idea started to bubble up about around this simple project: staying as long as possible on top of a platform. Antagonists, materialized in the form of various hazards, were added in order to coerce (directly or indirectly) the player off the platform. Frequency and power of these hazards increased over time, raising the probability of reaching the level’s finishing state. From this starting point, more elements were added, such as interactable platform edge blocks, destroyable floor tiles, backdrops, user interface and basic sound effects.</p>

<p>Two versions resulted from this. The first ad supported version was available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalball">Android mobile</a> devices only, having one playable level in single-player mode. Afterwards, a new adless version was released for <a href="https://www.ouya.tv/game/Survival-Ball/">OUYA</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalltv">Android TV</a> and Kongregate, featuring a new versus mode.</p>

<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Game prototype version for OUYA, Android TV and Kongregate</p>

<h1 id="reboot">Reboot</h1>

<p>I went to work on other projects after the prototype’s launch, but the feedback provided from gamers was kept in the back of my mind in the meanwhile. Several ideas eventually piled up for a new, improved version of the game, and about two years ago they were first brought to fruition. First at night after work, then full-time until completion.</p>

<p>Laying out a solid base was was essential in the beginning of the project, specially concept wise. Pre-production, if you will. Surviving on top of a platform was the root idea, but was there latitude for perpendicular ideas? Multiplayer mode? Versus or Cooperative? Online or local only? Powerups? Which player movements would be available, only jump? Progressive difficulty (the player does not choose the difficulty level) or bucket based difficulty (e.g. easy, normal, hard)? What will be the direction of visual style, audio, and code architecture? How many levels? What is the player’s motivation play these levels?</p>

<h2 id="root-ideas-and-game-modes">Root ideas and game modes</h2>

<p>Less is more when it comes to the game’s root ideas, and surviving on top of a platform seemed like a good premise. This idea was dissected and questioned thoroughly during the initial phase of development, in order to make sure it was well sustained. Other ideas such as going as high as possible or objective based levels were considered, but set aside in the initial stage of the project. They were not completely scrapped, such that both survival/time based and objective based levels would later cohabitate throughout the game’s development.</p>

<p>Assuming survival as the most important root idea, a question came up: survive what? It could be either you against the world, or you against other player(s), or a combination of both. The latter two options would prompt the need of a multiplayer versus mode and/or player AI, and the former one would naturally accommodate a single player and/or cooperation mode.</p>

<p>Allowing for a local multiplayer mode would be something desirable, since I had a personal bias towards games that physically join a group of friends in the same place. Also, online multiplayer was set aside due to the added entropy and complexity associated with it. </p>

<p>As for cooperative (co-op) games, there is usually an increased inclusion factor due to the wealth of opportunities to strike a balance between experienced and less experienced players, translating to less chances of frustration caused by huge proficiency gaps.</p>

<p>Given the above points, solo and local co-op modes were chosen to be included in the game.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>

<p>Again, having in mind that less is more, a progressive difficulty mode (where the player does not choose the difficulty level) was strived for, instead of a bucket based approach (e.g. easy, normal, hard). Choosing a difficulty level when starting a simple game like this one, forces the player to commit to a given difficulty level at start, and accepting that decision. The responsibility is on the player. Often happens to me that when I choose a difficulty level like “easy” or “normal”, I keep wondering throughout the game if I am really good at that game, or am I just being thrown softballs. Progressive difficulty resolves that problem immediately, but it falls on the developer shoulders to craft the game in such a way that all difficulty ranges are covered just right.</p>

<p>Progression would be 2-fold: each level would start in an accessible way, but would gradually get more difficult as time passes. On the other hand, each level would be more challenging than the last one during the campaign. </p>

<h2 id="control-and-movement">Control and movement</h2>

<p>There was the need to have offensive manuevers against hazards, and to provide mid-air control to the player. Two new movements were added to the already existing jump and double jump movements: dash and stomp. Dash provided mid-air control and allowed the player to interact with the world’s objects and attack hazards. Stomp, inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, allowed for button interaction, and mid-air stop and plunge for precise vertical landings.</p>

<p>With this set of movements, the player was able to gain full control over the ball. Easy to learn, hard to master. Additionally, it suppressed the need for aerial control via directional controls, which would be less physically coherent and could quench some of the fun of gaining control proficiency.  </p>

<h2 id="powerups">Powerups</h2>

<p>An assumption was made that powerups would be distributed randomly, either by items scattered throughout the level or by other means. Powerups were not used because of these four reasons: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Added game design complexity</strong> - every new powerup would increase the realm of possible scenarios during a game session, which would increase the difficulty of striking good game balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - simplicity was held at high value during development, and powerups would probably require the usage of a new button to trigger the power, more UI elements and new concepts for the player to grasp.</li>
  <li><strong>Skill based gameplay</strong> - the game aimed to be purely skill based. Since the randomized nature of hazards already abducted some of this intent, having powerups attributed by chance would further decrease the player’s perception that the level was completed by his/her own merit.</li>
  <li><strong>They could be used as crutches</strong> - powerups are outstanding when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollcage_(video_game)">used</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8">properly</a>, but can also be abused to cover up design flaws. Having a no-powerup limitation forced me think in alternative ways to make the game more interesting, a challenge I was drawn to. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-aesthetics">Visual Aesthetics</h2>

<p>Defining the game’s visual appearance early on was quite important, since it would influence the reasoning behind 3D models, textures, UI, colors, mood and even audio. The two most influential references were <a href="https://material.io/archive/guidelines/">Material Design (first version)</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/540840/Lara_Croft_GO/">Lara Croft GO</a>.</p>

<p>Coming from an Android development background, I was exposed to Material Design, which is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design. Its principles go beyond mobile UI development, and span to a swath of different form factors and use cases. I personally found it beautiful and applyed its principles throughout the game’s aesthetics, both in UI, but also in the overall style of the game. This influenced the game to have a simple, clean and coherent style.</p>

<p>Lara Croft GO is a beautiful game. The charming colors and elegant (yet simple) style made an impression on me. While building up the game’s aesthetics, I consulted several screenshots of Lara Croft GO and attempted to transpose its most pleasant design elements into Survival Ball.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/lara_croft_go_0.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="codebase">Codebase</h2>

<p>The prototype was a literal extension of the initial <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#prototype">wire chain and ball physics experiment</a>, and features were added at the same time I learned Unity’s ropes. This, added to rapid prototyping and little to no code architecture planning, resulted in a codebase that was entangled, difficult to follow and hard to extend.</p>

<p>The new version was built from scratch and several arquitectures were explored in the beginning of the project, until one was found to fit the game best. The chosen approach followed these principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each level had a single entry point, the game controller, which orquestrated the different actors.</li>
  <li>The game controller contained all top level parameters. Sub-parametrization was facilitated via <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html">Scriptable Objects</a>. For example, the PlayerController had PlayerParameters (which was a scriptable object) exposed on the game controller. The PlayerParameters could in turn have sub-parameters, if needed.</li>
  <li>Dynamic objects, such as the player, hazards and interactable level parts should be created programmatically whenever possible.</li>
  <li>The initial scene stage should only have static or decorative objects.</li>
  <li>Object behavior should be managed by its specific controller. Game object components should be presentational and have as little behaviour as possible. For example, a rocket thruster could have a component which changed the color and size of smoke and fire, but it would be the thruster’s controller responsibility to drive the input value for this component.</li>
  <li>Orquestration of events (from dynamic objects, user interaction and other data streams) was handled using a reactive approach, facilitated by <a href="https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx">UniRx</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="levels">Levels</h2>

<p>The level creation process went somewhere along these lines: I would go for a long walk without any audiobooks or entertainment, and allow my mind to wander around. If an idea came up, I would write it down in a <a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a> note. At a later time, in a quiet place, I would dissect these ideas on paper to materialize its pros and cons, while further developing the ideas that seemed most promising. </p>

<h3 id="first-sandbox">First Sandbox</h3>

<p>Before building any of the levels, a scrappy sandbox level was built to work out the broader strokes of the player’s movement. In this sandbox, movement, jump, stomp and dash (immediate single charge at the time) were first developed and loosely tweaked.</p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">

<h3 id="rocketx">RocketX</h3>

<p>SpaceX was landing their first rockets on drone ships when the first idea of the bunch was developed. It revolved around the concept of a four thruster rocket platform. Each of these thrusters could be activated or deactivated by their respective button. An additional center button turned all the thrusters on or off. The platform had a finite amount of fuel that could be replineshed by shoving fuel crates, hazards or players in the center fuel intake.</p>

<p>This level would set the tone for the upcoming ones, so it was important to pin down the core gameplay, level structure and hazard dynamics before moving on to the next level. Just like changing a cosmological parameter would drastically change everything in the universe (like the possiblity of life), the game’s basilar parameters were set as tightly as possibile early on, because even a small change could break other already built levels. For example, a small change in how fast the player is, how high can it jump or how gravity affects it, could translate into several hours of extra work to re-adjust every level accordingly, or even render them obsolete.</p>

<p>For these reasons, it took around 354 hours to develop the bulk of RocketX, about one fifth of the project’s timespan.      </p>

<h3 id="garfunkel">Garfunkel</h3>

<p>Original concept for the second level was a variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">Simon</a> game, hence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel">Garfunkel</a>. A sequence of lights would be played out first, and the player(s) would then have to mimic the same sequence afterwards by orderly hitting the respective target pieces, at the cost of the piece falling off if it were to be hit outside the sequence. There would exist as many platforms as the number of players.</p>

<p>A quick level layout was built. Soon after the first plays and it became apparent that the concept was flawed. Mimicking a sequence would mean that during the first phase, while the model sequence is played out, the player would be left to do nothing movementwise. Moreover, after the second or third prompt of the sequence, the player would most likely forget which came next, because his/her main focus would be getting the ball movement right and not hit any of the non sequenced tiles. Simon is about memory, Survival Ball is about motor skill.   </p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Initial Garfunkel prototype, exploring a variation of the Simon electronic game</p>

<p>Pivoting from this, came the idea of collapsing the two phases into a single phase, no memorization needed. The platform piece prompts would be immediate and coupled with the background music rhythm, which would progressivly get faster as time passed. The player would have limited time to hit these prompts, as the unhit prompted pieces would fall after each music measure.</p>

<p>There was only one platform, since having multiple platforms would elicit a natural exploit. The player could quickly notice that the best strategy would be to focus all energy in a single platform. There was no real gain to be had on saving all platforms. One would suffice, and would be easier for the player to manage.</p>

<p>The background music was programmatically played. The easiest approach was to individually play each audio sample, meaning that the rhythm was dictated by the frequency to which these were played. Long and complex audio samples were not fit for this purpose, since they had their own tempo, and only transforming these samples would correctly match them with the overall music tempo. Simple and short audio samples were used, specially drum samples, which worked great for this use case.</p>

 </div>
 </center>

<p>The music engine and platform movement were first tackled, and took a considerable amount of time to build. After a few playthroughs with these basic systems in place, something did not feel quite right. At the time, it seemed related with how the background looked like. Predominantly using drum samples, the overall music style suggested a tribal feel, and seemed important at the time to have a good match between the music and the level’s visual appearance, hence the different backdrop experiments.    </p>

<p>After these four different backdrops, something was still off. Progressively I realized that the real problem was related with the platform’s shape. In a circular platform, the best strategy is to safeguard the inner pieces, since they are easily reachable and have an inferior angular speed compared to the outer ones. Falling prey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy">sunk cost fallacy</a>, some attempts were made to save this concept: rotate the inner pieces at a higher speed or to rotate them in different axes; to implement piece decay, which released the piece if the player stayed on top of it for too long. None of them worked, since these obstacles could be easily bypassed, as shown by the above video number 3.</p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Final Garfunkel state. The level was scrapped but most of its elements were re-used in Beatmill and Big Giant Head</p>

<p>The last backdrop experiment was a simple water floor, which focused the player’s attention in the platform and had the additional benefit of having a near plane to which the player’s shadow could be casted. The vertical player shadow was a very important reference for the player’s position.</p>

<p>The level would need to be completely redesigned or scrapped altogether, since it was not acceptable in its current form. It ended up being scrapped, but the waterfall backdrop (video 2. above) was later reused by <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#unfair-fair">Unfair Fair</a>, and two new levels were forked from Garfunkel’s base elements: <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#beatmill">Beatmill</a> and <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#big-giant-head">Big Giant Head</a>.</p>

<h3 id="beatmill">Beatmill</h3>

<p>Beatmill addressed one of the major issues in Garfunkel, the easy exploit of the circular platform shape. Solution was to have several loose square pieces which were part of a cross or lengthwise treadmill. Randomly moving each piece along these two directions meant that no piece was permanently in the same area (like the center area) of the platform. Every single piece was important to treasure and save.</p>

<p>The treadmill system was developed from scratch, and Garfunkel’s music engine and water floor backdrop were reused. </p>

 </div>
 </center>

<p>After developing the level’s basic game elements and validating their gameplay via play testing, the decay concept was recycled from Garfunkel, with slight modifications. A special black button was placed as one of the platform’s pieces. If pressed, it decayed the adjacent pieces. If a decayed piece was touched, it would fall.</p>

<p>This concept apparently worked well, but when play tested with a group of friends, it was pointed out as being too punishing. When the special black button was pressed, the level’s difficulty skyrocketed, making the already difficult task of reaching prompted pieces even harder. As a result, pressing the black button was faced as a death kneel, urging players to restart the level right after the black button was pressed. After a few rounds of these, collective despair would soon grow due to the overwhelming difficulty.</p>

<p>Solution was to invert the black button’s function. Instead of decaying the adjacent pieces, it would revive them. This time around, the special black button was not avoided in fear, but in greed. It was a precious resource, to be used as a late as possible.  </p>

<h3 id="big-giant-head">Big Giant Head</h3>

<p>Garfunkel’s platform did not work in a survival setting, but could it work in a different setting? In order for it to work, the level’s progress could only advance when the player touched his/her respective prompt. An objective sequence. The level also needed a long term objective for these sequences to link up. Turns out the game campaign was lacking a final boss, and this could be a good opportunity to salvage Garfunkel’s platform (and its respective movement and prompt system) to a new level, the final one. The final boss.</p>

<p>The defined long term objective was to deplete the boss’s life, but the players needed a way to interact with it. The first idea was to drain the boss’s life every time a prompted platform piece was hit, but that bore two problems: interaction was too indirect and there was no opposite force that gave the boss a chance to defend itself. Hazards could be used to fulfil this purpose, but that dynamic was too easy and insipid. The final boss was expected to be more challenging than all its previous levels, and was expected to require the player to use most, if not all, of the previously aquired learnings.</p>

<p>Inspired by classic game bosses, which stack different boss stages, solution was to materialize the boss into an anthropomorphic head, and have the head appear in the center, equipped with a turret, when it was sufficiently small to fit platform’s center gap. The head shrank every time a sequence of prompted platform pieces were hit. The players could directly interact with the center head by hitting it, draining the boss’s life. Difficulty progression was accomplished by decaying a set of platform pieces every time the small center head was defeated.</p>

<h3 id="unfair-fair">Unfair Fair</h3>

<p>“Giant washing machine drum” was the initial concept behind this level. Challenge was to transform this germinal idea into a fun level, coherent with the game’s survival motto. Some scattered ideas were drafted on paper, such as having interactable controls to make the drum rotate in a given direction or to stop the rotation entirelly, but none of them were successfuly transformed in to a viable challenge or part of a larger challenge.</p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Hardcoded drum to validate to overall feel of the level</p>

<p>The most interesting avenue was to reuse the piece decay concept from Beatmill. In Unfair Fair, the decay was caused by a specific hazard, which if not hit by its respective player, exploded and decayed the nearby platform pieces. Once these pieces were touched, they fell. The pieces near the platform spokes were decayed at start, to increase the chances of partial or complete piece group detachment.</p>

<p>The first iteration of this hazard exploded after bouncing a given amount of times, which proved to be unfair for when the hazard bounces close to the ground, giving little opportunity for the player(s) to react. </p>

<p>The next and final iteration had the hazard explode a given time amount after its first bounce, which gave a fair chance for its dismantling. Visual presentation was reviewed to better present how close the hazard was to explode. The time taken to explode would decrease as the level progressed. </p>

<p>Notice the waterfall backdrop below, repurposed from one of Garfunkel’s experiments.     </p>

<h3 id="venom-rig">Venom Rig</h3>

<p>Upon Garfunkel’s closure, began the development of a concept revolving around an oil rig shaped platform. The platform had four pillars, each destroyed when their respective button was pressed. The player had no motivation to press them, but these could be pressed by stomper hazard developed previously for RocketX. Their only task was to press these buttons.</p>

<p>To add another challenge dimension, a concept from the game’s prototype was added: decay rockets (in the prototype they were represented as rectangular parallelepipeds). Upon landing, these hazards decayed the platform piece below until the piece was completely detached from the platform. Other hazards would be spawned throughout the lifecyle of the level for increased diversity.</p>

<h3 id="hex-elevator">Hex Elevator</h3>

<p>The initial concept on paper was a 2.5D level in which a fluid (water/lava) would progressively rise as the player(s) made their way up a series of platforms and objects. The rising fluid concept seemed promising, but having a series of fixed 2.5D platforms seemed somewhat bland and left little space for cooperation dynamics.</p>

<p>Solution was to have an infinite amount of procedurally generated platforms, each higher than the previous one. The only way to reach the next platform was via an elevator assigned to a specific player, which first had to be activated by touching all of its respective prompts. The elevators would only rise when all players occupied their respective elevator.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">Reb Blob Games’ guides</a> on hex grids were immensly useful when building the procedurally generated honeycomb platforms. These guides couple well explained theory with concise practical implementations, and I highly recommend them to anyone doing hex grid work.</p>

</center>

<p>Upon the first play test session with friends, it became apparent that small tweaks were required to the behaviour of elevators. Because elevators would only rise when all players were sitting on top of their respective elevator, a problem arised if, near the upper platform, someone abandoned the elevator earlier than others. At that point, all elevators would drop, taking most of the players with them.</p>

<p>Solution was to make each elevator independent when they were close the upper platform, allowing for a smoother team transition between platforms.  </p>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>Is is generally a good idea to write the introduction of a book, essay or paper last, since you need to have a very solid idea of the shape of the finished product, and exactly what you need to mention up front for everything to hold together. The tutorial level was left for last for the same reasons.</p>

<p>It was the game’s first level, and had the responsability to introduce the game and provide the required tools and knowledge to play it. Specifically, how to jump, double jump, dash and stomp. The overall concept of the level was inspired by an early version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgWTt5usQ4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=17">Gang Beasts’ tutorial</a>, which was pedagogic andp fun. Having the controls layed out as part of the scenario, instead of using an UI overlay fixture, was something quite interesting as well.</p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">First iteration. Functional, yet bland</p>

<p>The first iteration had some of the required pedagogic elements, but was static and insipid when played, even though it had some interactive elements.</p>

<p>The following idea was to have a series of small platforms sitting by a pond. The instability of these floating platforms imprinted a livelier dynamic and were more physically sound than the initial tutorial iteration.</p>

</div>
</center>

<p>After a play test with friends, it was noticeable that very few people understood how to dash, or how important the combination of jump, dash and stomps were to gain air control. </p>

<p>Solution was to add an animated billboard ilustrating how the dash charge worked, and add two additional sections focused on air control. The following play tests showed that these changes made a significant difference on a player’s comprehension of the game’s basilar movements and techniques. </p>

<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Final iteration with an animated dash charge billboard and new sections focused on air control</p>

<h3 id="extra-block-towers">Extra: Block Towers</h3>

<p>This level was not used, since no plausible game dynamics were found to fit the overall concept of the game, but the sheer fun and simplicity it provided while moving around high stacks of blocks were worth the special mention. </p>

<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">

<h2 id="menus-and-user-interface">Menus and User Interface</h2>

<p>Most of these interfaces were built in the late stages of development. Following the <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#visual-aesthetics">Visual Aesthetics</a> layed out earlier, the first rough screens were sketched out, starting by the home screen. Some experiments were made with the game’s logo and UI elements. UI buttons design for example, referred their colors and shape from a core element of the game, the hexagonal wave counter. </p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">First iteration of the home screen</p>

<p>At about the same time, the title screen was built. Presented when opening the game and right before the home screen, it was crafted to create an impactful first impression and to be later used for key art, showcasing the most important elements of the game: logo, players, enemies and some levels. Another important aspect was to illustrate that this was a co-op game, so the 4 players were placed in the forefront, aligned in such a way that no one was widely in front of anyone, with about equal highlight to all of them. The screen drew inspiration from other games’ key art, such as the one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land_2:_6_Golden_Coins">Super Mario Land 2</a>, which presented all game’s key elements in one powerful, stylized image. </p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>

<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Title screen</p>

<p>The home screen was later refined and the remaining screens were progressively built and polished. These were the options (video, audio and controls), player selection, pause, end game, game selection and stats screens.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>Music and sound effects were built using GarageBand. Many freely available sound libraries such as the <a href="https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc2017/">Sonniss GameAudioGDC Bundles</a> were used to mash up different samples into new sound effects.  </p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/main_screen_main_theme2.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/main_screen_main_theme2.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> GarageBand project for the main theme </figcaption></figure>

<p>Audio aimed to be clean and coherent, thus a small subset of samples were used from the immense libraries available and reused whenever possible, trying to settle with a mostly electronic style for music and to use instruments or natural audio effects for SFX.</p>

<h3 id="keys">Keys</h3>

<p>I believe coherency is gained when using a small set of musical keys throughout the game. Survival Ball only used the C major key and its relative minor, A minor. Major keys are genererally recognized as happier and joyful and minor keys as darker and heavier. In the game, each level or screen used one of these keys, according to the desired environment and feel. </p>

<p>One interesting nugget of knowledge I came to learn while developing the audio, was that sound effects also fit within a certain key. The overall audio will sound much better when sound effects and music are built in key accordance.  </p>

<h3 id="eq">EQ</h3>

<p>Another interesting tidbit was to remove the extremely low and high frequencies in the final mix. The effect is threefold: audio fatigue is reduced when editing; makes the overall composition seem cleaner to the listener; leaves more headroom in the audible frequency range, improving the composition’s focus and clarity.  </p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/eq_cutoff.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/eq_cutoff.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Extremely low and high frequencies cutoff in the master bus&#8217; EQ </figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>

<p>The game ended up having more than 60 different sound effects and around <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/997540">20 musical segments</a>. A considerable amount of time was wasted checking on a given audio segment status, so a simple spreadsheet was used to track the name, category and its state (done, needs revision, missing). This simple sheet improved the audio creation process considerably. </p>

<h2 id="play-tests">Play Tests</h2>

<h3 id="ai-agents">AI agents</h3>

<p>Having the need to perform many iterations and tweaks without constant access to other testers, a simple AI was built to simulate multiplayer dynamics and to have a better grasp of how the level handles these dynamics.</p>

<p>AI agents were specific to each level, and driven by a series of objectives. For example, in Beatmill, the agent’s main objective was to reach its respective colored prompt. If no prompts existed, it would move towards the platform’s center, the optimal place to wait for a prompt. It also had passive behaviours such as avoidance of gaps or special black buttons via jumps. As seen in the video below, the agents are not perfect, but set a good work baseline.</p>

<div>
    <div class="youtube-player"></div>
</div>
<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Beatmill (non published early version): the blue, green and yellow players are controlled by AI</p>

<h3 id="user-tests">User Tests</h3>

<p>Once roughly tweaked, the game was presented (preferably for the first time) to a group of friends during a play test session. These sessions were of uttermost value, since they provided valuable feedback, critics and/or validation to the various game elements.</p>

<p>There were 6 play test sessions in total. Apart from how valuable these were to improve the game, they were also a great opportunity to gather a group of friends and have a good time. The game was modified and tweaked between each session, after digesting the impressions and feedback of the previous one.</p>

<p>The game had some backdoor hooks which allowed for quick macro difficulty tweaks, e.g. how many waves were necessary to unlock a level. These were specially useful in the first play session, since the game was extremelly punishing in its early incarnations.</p>

<p>Some guidelines I tried to follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refrained from playing. I only joined if the backdoor hooks were not enough to lower the difficulty to a point that was enjoyable by the players. I could infrequently join near the session’s end and most of the feedback had been provided.</li>
  <li>I sat behind the players, writing impressions and feedback. Sporadically I asked for more details on a comment or behaviour that I observed. Being an observer, it is also easier to probe for mood fluctuations in the room. For example, when frustration starts to build up due to the extreme difficulty of a level, it is easily noticeable when observing from outside. The same applies for bursts of joy a given level or dynamic might cause.</li>
  <li>Gut reactions were very precious, so I would probe for more details on these reactions and encourage honest reactions and feedback.  </li>
  <li>After the game was finished, I asked the players about their impressions, what they liked, they did not like, the level they enjoyed the most and the level they enjoyed the least. On that note, RocketX, Hex Elevator and Big Giant Head were top favorites. Venom Rig, Unfair Fair and Beatmill were most often referred as the less enjoyable of the bunch.</li>
  <li>Only explained the reasons behind a given design decision after the game was finished and most of the feedback had been given, to diminish the influence of my opinion on the players feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="launch">Launch</h1>

<p>The game was launched on November 8th, 2018. One month earlier, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/918690">Steam store page</a>, <a href="https://survivalball.com/">official website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/survivalball">twiter account</a> were brought online. During that month, a closed beta ran on Steam, which served mostly for last mile validations, since the bulk of the iterations were made during the in-person play testing phase. At the same time, several dozens of keys were sent to youtubers, with notable regard to the ones specialized in couch co-op games. To the ones contacted by email, I took into attention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Qf1aQHqyc">this video by Stephen</a>, where he describes what kind of emails he expects to receive from developers. </p>

<p>After launch, I was advised by fellow developers that the above strategy was not optimal, because it is usually a good idea to build your following by sharing your progress and interacting with the community during development (via social networks or dev blogs for example), potentially increasing the game’s exposure and sales. In a possible new game, it would be interesting to adopt this strategy and take note of how workflow and game design would be influenced.</p>

<h1 id="indie-x">Indie X</h1>

<p>Shortly after completing the first beta build of the game, I submitted my application to <a href="https://indiex.pt/">Indie X</a>, the biggest indie game showcase/contest in Portugal. Fortunately, Survival Ball was accepted as one of the 55 finalists, meaning that it would be showcased at Lisboa Games Week 2018 a week after the game’s launch!</p>

<p>A custom build was specially crafted for the event. To better fit the event’s environment, the build offered an arcade experience through local leaderbords for the players with the highest number of completed waves, and leaderboards for the fastest players to finish Big Giant Head or the Tutorial. A simple controls cheat sheet was added to the pause menu, and the end game screens were changed to allow the players to enter their (group) name to the leaderboard. All levels were unlocked in this build, avoiding the need to finish the campaign to access a specific level.</p>

<p class="media-caption media-caption-one">Highlights of the custom build for Lisboa Games Week 2018 showcase</p>

<p>The event surpassed all my expectations. It was the first time I saw, in person, swathes of anonymous people playing Survival Ball. It was pleasantly surprising to recurrently see many groups of gamers trying out the game, playing for hours, and even returning back to the booth at a later time. Not much sleep was had during those four days, but it was rewarding to witness such moments.</p>

<h2 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The game was developed in macOS. Windows was mostly used to work out the particularities of its respective build, such as build post-processing work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/chetfaliszek/status/1085957214781595648">In case you need one more reason</a> on why to use version control for your game project: time travel. The game was under version control since day one, and its git repository has around 1.3K commits at the time of this writing. Going back in time was as simple as checking out an older commit. Almost all videos presented throughout this article were made possible because of this. Checkout, open project, record, repeat. Not only that, but it was fairly easy to see how work evolved over time, which helped immensely when writing this article.</li>
  <li>Most challenging aspect was to make sure everything was coherent. Once root concepts, design and objectives were aligned and the early level prototypes felt good when played, then filling out the gaps (refining gameplay, models, textures, audio, UI) was somewhat straightforward.</li>
  <li>The game’s development could be divided in three phases:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First phase (until first alpha build)</strong> - bulk of the development work was done during this phase. Very intense in terms of making sure everything was coherent, sane and enjoyable to play. There were large temporally contiguous blocks of work on each level.</li>
      <li><strong>Second phase (first alpha to public launch)</strong> - development was scattered, moving from place to place, iterating where needed and finishing up peripheral features such as Steam integration. </li>
      <li><strong>Third phase (from launch onwards)</strong> - maintenance work, user support, optimizations and bug fixes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I had an amazing experience building this game and am very happy with the final result. Not only did it materialize one of my dreams, but gave me the opportunity to explore and deepen areas outside my professional expertise, such as 3D modeling/texturing, audio production and game design. If you are a game developer or are thinking on becoming one, I hope this testimony was useful for your journey and hopefully brought more clarity into the process 🙌</li>

<p>Mostly invisible, yet essential, camera work is key to any game with dynamic cameras. This article dissects a concise Unity <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/unity-camera-multi-target">open source</a> library which dynamically keeps a set of objects (e.g. players and important objects) in view, a common problem for a wide range of games.</p>

<p>The library was developed for, and used by my first Steam game, <a href="https://survivalball.com/">Survival Ball</a>. The game has an heavy shared screen local co-op component, which requires the camera to dynamically keep many key elements in view.</p>

<p>There are good camera resources for Unity, but I found them to either do too much or too little for this specific problem, so I thought this could be a good opportunity to learn a bit more about dynamic camera movement and to share that knowledge and <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#where-to-get-it">code</a> with the community.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>The library is fed with the desired camera rotation (pitch, yaw and roll), the target objects that will be tracked and the camera that will be transformed. </p>

<p>The library’s sole responsibility is to calculate a camera position in which all targets lie inside its view. To achieve this, all target objects are projected onto a slice (plane) of the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnderstandingFrustum.html">camera’s view frustrum</a>. The projections located inside the view frustrum will be visible and the others will not. The idea is to trace back a new camera position from the outermost target projections, since this way we are guaranteed to include all projections inside the view.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/side_view_screen_basis_with_captions.png" /></p>

<p>In order to make the bulk of the operations easier to compute, the process starts by multiplying the camera’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation#Using_quaternion_as_rotations">inverse rotation</a> with each of the targets positions, which will place them as they would if the camera’s axis would be aligned with the world’s axis (identity rotation). Once the camera position is calculated in this transformed space, the camera rotation is multiplied by this position, resulting in the final desired camera position. The actual camera position is then progressively interpolated towards this desired position, to smooth out the camera movement.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<p>Most of the operations are performed in the transformed space where the camera’s axis would be aligned with the world’s axis (identity rotation). After the targets are rotated into the camera’s identity rotation space by multiplying the camera’s inverse rotation with each of the targets positions, the first task is to calculate their projections.</p>

<p>Please note that in all the figures below (with the exception of the <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#horizontal-projections"><em>horizontal field of view angle</em></a> section), the camera is present for reference only, as its final desired position will only be uncovered in the final step.</p>

<h2 id="targets-projections">Targets projections</h2>

<p>For each target, four projections are cast to a plane parallel to the view plane, sliced from the camera’s view frustrum. The line described from the target object to its respective projection is parallel to the camera’s view frustrum edges. Relative to the camera, two of these projections run horizontally, and the other two vertically.</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_intro/projections_1.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_intro/projections_1.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Perspective view of the targets projections </figcaption></figure>
<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_intro/projections_2.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_intro/projections_2.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Side view of the targets projections </figcaption></figure>
<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_intro/projections_3.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_intro/projections_3.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Top view of the targets projections </figcaption></figure>

<p>If any of the target’s projections are outside the camera’s view frustrum (or its sliced plane), then the target object will not be visible. If they are inside, the target object will be visible. This means that the four outermost projections from all targets will define the limit of where the view frustrum must be in order to have all objects in view or partially in view. Adding some padding to these outermost projections (i.e. moving these projections away from the center of the view frustrum plane slice), will result in additional padding between the target object and the camera’s view borders.</p>

<h3 id="vertical-projections">Vertical projections</h3>

<p>For all vertical projections positions, we are interested in finding their Y component. In the figure below, notice the right triangle with one vertex on the target object and another one on the projection. If we discover the length of the side running parallel the projection plane, that value can be added to the Y component of the target’s position, resulting in the Y component for the upper projection.</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_calc/projections_calc_with_captions_vertical.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_calc/projections_calc_with_captions_vertical.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Side view of the elements needed to calculate the vertical projections </figcaption></figure>

<p> is equal to half the camera’s vertical field of view angle  (). The vertical field of view angle  is provided by the camera’s <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera-fieldOfView.html"><code>fieldOfView</code></a> in degrees, which needs to be converted to radians for our purposes ().</p>

<p>The triangle’s adjacent edge length (relative to ) is known, thus we can find the length of the opposite side of the triangle by using <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-trig/hs-geo-trig-ratios-intro/a/finding-trig-ratios-in-right-triangles">trigonometric ratios</a>.</p>



<p>With this, the upper projection’s Y/Z components can be fully calculated. The bottom projection has the same Z component as the upper one, and its Y component is equal to the target’s Y component minus the calculated opposite triangle edge length.</p>

<h3 id="horizontal-projections">Horizontal projections</h3>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_calc/projections_calc_with_captions_horizontal.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_calc/projections_calc_with_captions_horizontal.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Top view of the elements needed to calculate the horizontal projections </figcaption></figure>

<p>The horizontal projections follow a set of similar set of calculations, difference being that we are now interested in finding the X component (instead of Y), and the horizontal field of view angle is used instead of the vertical one. The horizontal field of view angle  and its half value  () need some further steps to be computed, which will be detailed in the following section.</p>

<h4 id="horizontal-field-of-view-angle">Horizontal field of view angle</h4>

<p>Consider the following figure, in which  represents half the horizontal field of view angle,  represents half the vertical field of view angle,  the viewport width and  the viewport height:</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/horizontal_fov.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/horizontal_fov.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Elements for the calculation of the horizontal field of view angle </figcaption></figure>

<p>Using trigonometric ratios, these two equations can be devised:</p>



<p>Replacing  in the first equation with the definition of the second one:</p>



<p>Unity’s camera has an <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera-aspect.html"><code>aspect</code></a> attribute (view canvas width divided by height, i.e. ), with which we can finalize our equation and discover the horizontal field of view angle half value.</p>



<h3 id="outermost-projections">Outermost projections</h3>

<p>Having all target projections calculated, the four outermost ones are picked:</p>

<ul>
  <li> is the projection with the highest X component</li>
  <li> is the projection with the lowest X component</li>
  <li> is the projection with the highest Y component</li>
  <li> is the projection with the lowest Y component</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_outermost/projections_outermost.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_outermost/projections_outermost.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> All outermost projections </figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="calculating-the-camera-position">Calculating the camera position</h2>

<h3 id="in-the-transformed-space">In the transformed space</h3>

<p>The X and Y components of the desired camera position in the transformed space are the midpoints of their respective outermost projections, this is, the midpoint between  and  is the camera’s X position, and the midpoint between  and  is the camera’s Y position.</p>

<p>The Z component of the camera position in the transformed space is calculated by backtracking a view frustrum from the the outermost projections to the camera Z component candidate. The furthest Z component from the projection plane will be the chosen, in order for the final camera position to contain all targets within its view.</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_distance/projections_distance_with_captions_vertical.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_distance/projections_distance_with_captions_vertical.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Elements for adjacent<sub>v</sub> calculation </figcaption></figure>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_distance/projections_distance_with_captions_horizontal.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/camera_multi_target/projections_distance/projections_distance_with_captions_horizontal.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Elements for adjacent<sub>h</sub> calculation </figcaption></figure>

<p>Once again, trigonometric ratios will be used to calculate these Z position candidates.</p>



<p>The highest value between  and  will be picked for the camera’s Z position component in the transformed space.</p>

<h3 id="final-camera-position-in-the-original-space">Final camera position in the original space</h3>

<p>With the camera position calculated in the transformed space, we can now multiply the desired camera rotation with this position, which will provide us with the final desired camera position. The actual camera position is then progressively interpolated towards this desired position, to smooth out the camera movement.</p>

<p>ArXiv Papers is an <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/arxiv-papers-mobile">open source</a> mobile application to search, download and save arXiv papers. It was developed using a react native / redux framework and is currently available for smartphone and tablet devices. You can get it on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.arxiv">Google Play</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Often I would find myself downloading the same arXiv paper on my phone because it would get buried in the “downloads” folder under the default arXiv id file name, so instead of sifting through a myriad of already downloaded PDFs I would just revisit the paper’s web page and redownload it.</p>

<p>Organizing each paper neatly into its proper folder with a more discernable filename is quite laborious on a mobile device and the apps I tried out either did too much or too little. I just wanted to quickly search an arXiv article and quickly refer to the ones I downloaded.</p>

<p>This seemed not only a good opportunity to leverage on <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/api/index">arXiv’s public API</a> and develop this idea into an application, but also to expand from Android native development and dive into cross platform app development, specifically Android/iOS.</p>

<h1 id="bootstraping">Bootstraping</h1>

<p>Cross platform mobile app development frameworks come far and wide, so the plan was to go through them, choose one framework, learn its foundations, and attempt to solidify my understanding of its various concepts, advantages, pains and quirks by using it in this new application.</p>

<p>I went shopping for a suitable framework and eventually settled with react native/redux. It seemed like a good fit for the project and a valuable add to my programming tool belt. React and redux had been around for a while and were quite mature and capable at that point. The react native library did not reach a major version yet, but appeared to be quite solid and had a rich ecosystem, vibrant community and various <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1189117404435352/react-native-for-android-how-we-built-the-first-cross-platform-react-native-app/">successful</a> <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/react-native-at-soundcloud">use</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qCociUB6aQ">cases</a> in demanding production apps.</p>

<p>I first built my foundations through courses (<a href="https://egghead.io/instructors/dan-abramov">Dan Abramov’s</a> react and redux courses are wonderful), examples, lectures, tutorials, documentation and articles. I was pleasantly impressed with the <a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app">CRNA</a> project’s workflow and how it enables you to develop an entire application without touching a single native implementation piece. However, Android and iOS are two distinct platforms, with different design and UX paradigms, meaning that even unejected applications should be specifically tailored for each platform. With this in mind, and knowing that I would need native integrations to download papers for example, I decided to narrow the scope to Android only, but a potential future iOS version should not be a huge pain.</p>

<h1 id="design">Design</h1>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/arxiv-papers/arxiv_layout_mockup.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/arxiv-papers/arxiv_layout_mockup.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Final Android smartphone app design, made in Sketch </figcaption></figure>

<p>After a few iterations, the above design seemed like a good compromise between functionality, breadth and ease of use. Most importantly, it catered to the app’s motif: search, download and save arXiv articles. </p>

<p>Many, if not all of the apps I explored, allowed the user to browse through arXiv’s categories. For this application however, it did not seem to be an essential feature. Browsing categories serves discoverability, but I am assuming that whoever uses this app would at least have a rough idea of what she is looking for. In that case, keyword search can fill that use case. Looking for DeepMind’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>? Write “deep atari” and the paper you are looking for appears on the first page.</p>

<p>Bookmark-wise, the assumption is that if you download a paper, then most probably it is something your are interested in, thus the higher the probability for its recall. How about merging the two concepts? You are on the article’s details screen, you download it, read it if you wish, and when you arrive back at the home screen, it will be available for immediate recall.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<p>React by itself is a library which could be seen as the view in model-view-controller, whereas react native builds upon it by providing native component rendering, and redux is used for state management. Moreover, I chose to use <a href="https://redux-observable.js.org/">Redux Observable</a> to handle redux action side effects, <a href="https://nativebase.io/">Native Base</a> for most of the UI components, Flow for type safety, <a href="https://github.com/wix/detox">Detox</a> for end to end tests and Jest for unit and integration tests.</p>

<h2 id="action-side-effects">Action Side Effects</h2>

<p>Redux Observable does not seem to be a popular choice for action side effects, when compared with redux sagas for example, but I think it offers one of the best solutions in this domain. At its core it uses rxJS, a library for reactive programming, which is a natural fit for the asynchronous nature of redux action side effects. This approach is inherently declarative, provides powerful composition (complex async tasks godsend) and makes it easy to cancel async tasks, a common edge case which is often overlooked and can make the difference between an OK application and a very solid application. </p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Application logic was contained inside the action’s handlers, selectors and reducers, so I chose not to test the react components because the unit and integration tests could extract an higher value when applied to the before mentioned triad. Adding to this, ESLint was used for code quality control and catching basic errors, and much of the application was typed using Flow. Redux Observable epics were not type checked, since at the moment there are <a href="https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/258">no meaningful type definitions available</a>.</p>

<p>Integration tests were done for the different application modules (articles, papers, etc), using actions as inputs and selectors as outputs; action side effects were tested separately in their respective unit tests. More unit tests could be made to each of the redux units and further satisfy the traditional test pyramid, but the before mentioned static analysis served as a good foundation and most of the module’s inner code paths were covered by the aforementioned tests, so I opted for a more a pragmatic approach, one which could yield a higher value with minimum developer effort.</p>

<p>To encompass the whole application, end to end tests were built with the aid of Detox. Detox’s android support is still nearing completion, but appears to be a very promising solution. One of its most distinctive features, when compared with popular black box testing frameworks like Appium, is its direct integration with the native layers via EarlGrey for iOS and Espresso for Android, translating to more stable, faster and less flaky tests. Using it was straightforward, the API is well designed and it did not stand in the way while writing the tests. Overall, a good experience for this small application.</p>

<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h2>

<p>Regarding folder structure, I opted for a feature based tree which branched into framework concepts (reducer, action, selector, react component, redux observable epic). As it typically happens in other domains, using the framework’s concepts as the root of your folder structure works great for small applications, but as complexity grows, root division by features makes the structure much easier to extend and reason about.</p>

<title>React Native Offscreen Toolbar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In material design, there is a <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/scrolling-techniques.html#scrolling-techniques-behavior">common scrolling technique</a> in which the toolbar is smoothly tucked away while scrolling down and is made visible again when scrolling up. This behaviour is fairly straightforward to implement when developing a native android app, but for a react native app, the best solution I found was <a href="https://medium.com/appandflow/react-native-collapsible-navbar-e51a049b560a">Janic Duplessis’</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-offscreen-toolbar">library</a> I am releasing today is an encapsulation of this behaviour and its implementation is heavily based on Janic Duplessis’ approach.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use it</h2>

<p>Installation:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ $ npm install react-native-offscreen-toolbar --save
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Usage (full example <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/react-native-offscreen-toolbar/tree/master/example">here</a>):</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>import OffscreenToolbar from 'react-native-offscreen-toolbar';
 
export default class YourComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const toolbar = () =&gt; (&lt;ToolbarAndroid title={'Title'} /&gt;);
        const listItem = ({item}) =&gt; &lt;Text&gt;{item.key}&lt;/Text&gt;;
        const scrollable = () =&gt; (&lt;FlatList data={DUMMY_DATA} renderItem={listItem}/&gt;);
        return (
            &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;
                &lt;OffscreenToolbar
                    toolbar={toolbar}
                    scrollable={scrollable} /&gt;
            &lt;/View&gt;
        );
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>You can pass any component you desire as a <code>toolbar</code>, but typically this will be a toolbar/navbar backed by react native or a UI library of your choice, like <a href="https://nativebase.io/">Native Base</a>.</p>

<p>The scrollable however, will need to be scrollable component such as a <code>ScrollView</code>, <code>ListView</code>, <code>FlatList</code>, etc. The <code>OffscreenToolbar</code> will then create hooks around this component in order to gauge the user’s scrolling behaviour and change toolbar’s animation accordingly.</p>

<p>You can also provide the following properties to the component:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>scrollableOverlay</code>: for a search screen as the one presented above, this component can be used to present an overlay between the scrollable and the toolbar</li>
  <li><code>toolbarHeight</code>: adjust this property according to your toolbar height. This value is used for the toolbar’s animation</li>
  <li><code>scrollablePaddingTop</code>: since the scrollable is laying behind the toolbar, this property comes in handy to place the scrollable content below the toolbar</li>
</ul>

<p>Above is the built <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/">deep Q-network (DQN)</a> agent playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run">Out Run</a>, trained for a total of 1.8 million frames on a Amazon Web Services g2.2xlarge (GPU enabled) instance. The agent was built using python and tensorflow. The Out Run game emulator is a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/cannonball">Cannonball</a>. All source code for this project is <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/machine_learning/2016/10/06/deep-reinforcement-learning-racing-game.html#source-code">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The agent learnt how to play by being rewarded for high speeds and penalized for crashing or going off road. It fetched the game’s screens, car speed, number of off-road wheels and collision state from the emulator and issued actions to it such as pressing the left, right, accelerate or brake virtual button. </p>

<p>Agent trainer implements the deep Q-learning algorithm used by <a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/nature14236?shared_access_token=Lo_2hFdW4MuqEcF3CVBZm9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P5kedCCNjz3FJ2FhQCgXkApOr3ZSsJAldp-tw3IWgTseRnLpAc9xQq-vTA2Z5Ji9lg16_WvCy4SaOgpK5XXA6ecqo8d8J7l4EJsdjwai53GqKt-7JuioG0r3iV67MQIro74l6IxvmcVNKBgOwiMGi8U0izJStLpmQp6Vmi_8Lw_A%3D%3D">Google’s DeepMind Team to play various Atari 2600 games</a>. It uses a reward function and hyperparameters that fit best for Out Run, but could potentially be used to <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#plugging-other-problems-and-games">play other games or solve other problems</a>.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of <a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#further-references">good information</a> about this reinforcement learning algorithm, but I found some topics difficult to grasp or contextualize solely from the information available online. I will attempt to add my humble contribution by tackling these and also provide details about the project’s implementation, results and how it can be used/modified/deployed.</p>

<p>Let’s start by one of its main gears: Q-learning</p>

<p></p>

<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>

<h2 id="q-learning">Q-learning</h2>

<p>At the heart of deep Q-learning lies Q-learning, a popular and effective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=258&amp;v=bFPoHrAoPoQ">model-free</a> algorithm for learning from delayed reinforcement.  </p>

<p>Jacob Schrum has made available a terse and accessible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4uSLeZ-ET3xLlkPVEGw9Bn4Z8Mbp-SQc">explanation</a> which takes around 45 minutes to watch and serves as a great starting point for the paragraphs below. 
Let’s take the canonical reinforcement learning example presented by Jacob (grid world):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/gridworld.png" /></p>

<p>To implement this algorithm, we need to build the Q-function (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLkW_WGJoyQ">one of the forms</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation">Bell-Equation</a>) by using the Q-value iteration update:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/q_value_iteration_update.svg" /></p>

<p>In the above grid, there are 9 actionable states, 2 terminal states and 4 possible actions (left, right, up, down), resulting in 36 (9 actionable states x 4 possible actions) Q-values.</p>

<p>This project aims to train an agent to play Out Run via its game screens, so for the sake of argument, let´s consider that each game screen is transformed into a 80x80 greyscale image (each pixel value ranging from 0 to 255), and that each transformed image represents a state. 6400 pixels (80x80) and 256 possible values per pixel translate to 256<sup>6400</sup> possible states. This value alone is a good indicator of how inflated the number of possible Q-values will be.</p>

<p>Multiplying <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/game/action.py">9 possible actions</a> by 256<sup>6400</sup> possible states results in 256<sup>6400</sup> x 9 possible Q-values. If we use multiple and/or colored images for state representation, then this value will be even higher. Quite unwieldy if we want to store these values in a table or similar structure.</p>

<h2 id="enter-deep-neural-networks">Enter deep neural networks</h2>

<p>Deep neural networks work quite well for inferring the mapping implied by data, giving them the ability to predict an approximated output from an input that they never saw before. No longer do we need to store all state/action pair’s Q-values, we can now model these mappings in a more general, less redundant way. These networks also automatically learn a set of internal features which are useful in complex non-linear mapping domains, such as image processing, releasing us from laborious feature handcrafting tasks.</p>

<p>This is perfect. We can now use a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function: the network would accept a state/action combination as input and would output the corresponding Q-value. Training-wise, we would need the network’s Q-value output for a given state/action combo (obtained through a forward pass) and the target Q-value, which is calculated through the expression: . With these two values, we can perform a gradient step on the squared difference between the target Q-value and the network’s output.</p>

<p>This is perfect, but there is still room for improvement. Imagine we have 5 possible actions for any given state: when calculating the target Q-value, to get the optimal future value estimate (consequent state’s maximum Q-value) we need to ask (forward pass) our neural network for a Q-value 5 times per learning step.</p>

<p>Another approach (used in <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf">DeepMind’s</a> <a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/nature14236?shared_access_token=Lo_2hFdW4MuqEcF3CVBZm9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P5kedCCNjz3FJ2FhQCgXkApOr3ZSsJAldp-tw3IWgTseRnLpAc9xQq-vTA2Z5Ji9lg16_WvCy4SaOgpK5XXA6ecqo8d8J7l4EJsdjwai53GqKt-7JuioG0r3iV67MQIro74l6IxvmcVNKBgOwiMGi8U0izJStLpmQp6Vmi_8Lw_A%3D%3D">network</a>) would be to feed in the game’s screens and have the network output the Q-value for each possible action. This way, a single forward pass would output all the Q-values for a given state, translating into one forward pass per optimal future value estimate.</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/q_network_formulations.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/q_network_formulations.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Image courtesy of Tambet Matiisen’s <a href="https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning">Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> - Left: Naive formulation of deep Q-network. Right: More optimized architecture of deep Q-network, used in DeepMind papers. </figcaption></figure>

<p>Q-learning and deep neural networks are the center pieces of a deep Q-network reinforcement learning agent and I think that by understanding them and how they fit together, it can be easier to picture how the algorithm works as a whole.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/overall_view_play.png"><img align="center" alt="" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/overall_view_play.png" /></a></center>

<p></p>

<p>Above is an overall representation of how the different components relate during a play evaluation, centered around the <code>deep Q-network for playing</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://lopespm.com/atom.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the main decision component.</p>

<p>Each game screen is resized to a desaturated 80x80 pixels image (opposed to 84x84 on DeepMind’s papers), and if you might be wondering why each state is a sequence of four game screens instead of one, that is because the agent’s history is used for better motion perception. Achieving this requires a sequence of preprocessed images to be stacked in channels (like you would stack RGB channels on a colored image) and fed to the network. Note that RGB channels and agent history could be used simultaneously for state representation. For example, with three channels per (RGB) image and an agent history length of four, the network would be fed twelve channels per input state.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/trainer/q_network.py#L121">network’s architecture</a> is essentially the same used by DeepMind, except for the first convolutional neural network’s input (80x80x4 instead of 84x84x4, to account for the different input sizes) and the linear layer’s output (9 instead of 18, to account for the different number of actions available)</p>

<p>The algorithm used to train this network is well described <a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/nature14236?shared_access_token=Lo_2hFdW4MuqEcF3CVBZm9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P5kedCCNjz3FJ2FhQCgXkApOr3ZSsJAldp-tw3IWgTseRnLpAc9xQq-vTA2Z5Ji9lg16_WvCy4SaOgpK5XXA6ecqo8d8J7l4EJsdjwai53GqKt-7JuioG0r3iV67MQIro74l6IxvmcVNKBgOwiMGi8U0izJStLpmQp6Vmi_8Lw_A%3D%3D">here (page 7)</a> and <a href="https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/">here</a>, but I would like to present it graphically, to hopefully provide some further intuition.</p>

<p>Below is <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer">agent trainer</a>´s implementation of the aforementioned algorithm. It adds some new concepts which were not approached by this article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experience replay mechanism sported by replay memories: randomly samples previous transitions, thereby smoothing the training distribution over many past behaviors</li>
  <li>Separate training network, cloned at fixed intervals to the target playing network, making the algorithm more stable when compared with standard online Q-learning</li>
  <li>ε-greedy policy to balance exploitation/exploration</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2 id="reward-function">Reward function</h2>

<p>The reward function’s definition is crucial for good learning performance and determines the goal in a reinforcement learning problem. April Yu et al. have an interesting paper on <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports2016/112_Report.pdf">simulated autonomous vehicle control</a> which details a DQN agent used to drive a game that strongly resembles Out Run (<a href="http://codeincomplete.com/games/racer/v4-final/">JavaScript Racer</a>). Based on their reward function experiments, I’ve built a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/trainer/episode.py#L60">function</a> which rewards logarithmically based on speed and penalizes when the car is off-road, crashed or stopped. </p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/reward_function_plot.png"><img src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/dqn_outrun/reward_function_plot.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Reward values for when the car is not crashed or off-road </figcaption></figure>

<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>

<p>Run the trainer and emulator on your local machine by following the guide available on <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/README.md">agent-trainer’s readme</a>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to deploy the agent to an AWS EC2 instance or generic Linux remote machine by using a set of bash scripts offered by <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer-deployer">agent-trainer-deployer</a>.</p>

<h3 id="aws-ec2">AWS EC2</h3>

<p>Amazon allows you to bid on spare EC2 computing capacity via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">spot instances</a>. These can cost a fraction of on-demand ones, and for this reason were chosen as the prime method for training in this project, leading to the need for mid-training instance termination resilience.</p>

<p>To accommodate this scenario, the deployment scripts and agent-trainer are designed to support train session resumes. To persist results and decrease boot up time between sessions, a long-lived EBS volume is attached to the live instance. The volume contains the training results, agent-trainer´s source code, cannonball’s source code, dockerfiles and their respective docker images. </p>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<p>The hyperparameters used on all sessions mimic the ones used on DeepMind’s <a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/nature14236?shared_access_token=Lo_2hFdW4MuqEcF3CVBZm9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P5kedCCNjz3FJ2FhQCgXkApOr3ZSsJAldp-tw3IWgTseRnLpAc9xQq-vTA2Z5Ji9lg16_WvCy4SaOgpK5XXA6ecqo8d8J7l4EJsdjwai53GqKt-7JuioG0r3iV67MQIro74l6IxvmcVNKBgOwiMGi8U0izJStLpmQp6Vmi_8Lw_A%3D%3D">Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning paper</a>, except for the number of frames skipped between actions, which are spaced apart by 450ms (equivalent to 13 frames) on agent-trainer.</p>

<p>The Out Run game, as you would play it in an arcade, clutters the road with various cars in order to make the game more challenging. In-game traffic was disabled for both training and evaluation plays, rendering a more achievable starting point for these experiments. Training with random traffic could be an interesting posterior experiment.</p>

<p>Some experiments were made by increasing the discount factor up its final value during training, as proposed on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02011">“How to Discount Deep Reinforcement Learning: Towards New Dynamic Strategies”</a>, but did not achieve better stability or rewards when compared to a fixed 0.99 discount factor. The aforementioned paper also proposes decaying the learning rate during training, which increased stability and performance significantly. Decaying the learning rate without minimum value clipping yielded the best results.</p>

<p>Another improvement was to train the game without a time limit, meaning that the training episode would only finish when the car reached the last stage’s end. This allowed for a broader replay memory training set, since the agent traversed a wide range of different tracks and settings.</p>

<p>Play evaluation was the same between all experiments, this is, the agent was evaluated by playing on the default 80 second, easy mode.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the most relevant training sessions (you can find their models, metrics and visualizations on <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer-results">agent-trainer-results</a>):</p>

<p>Notice on the videos above how the timed mode trained session <code>201609111241_2700eps</code> reaches the first checkpoint about five seconds earlier than the unlimited time mode trained session <code>201609171218_175eps</code>, but proceeds to drive off-road two turns after. Its stability gets increasingly compromised as more episodes are trained, which can be observed by the rampant loss increase before 7300 episodes are reached (<code>201609111241_7300eps</code>):</p>

<p>Both <code>201609111241_2700eps</code> and <code>201609111241_7300eps</code> timed trained sessions mostly drive off-road and stall after the first stage, whereas the unlimited time mode trained session <code>201609171218_175eps</code> can race through all the stages crashing <em>only</em> three times (as shown on the article’s first video) and is able to match the performance of a timed trained session when evaluated on the default easy timed mode. </p>

<h1 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h1>

<h2 id="plugging-other-problems-and-games">Plugging other problems and games</h2>

<p>Agent-trainer was not built from the get-go to train games or problems other than Out Run, but I think it would be interesting to perform a thought exercise on what would be necessary to do so.</p>

<p>There are three main areas in which <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer">agent-trainer</a> has domain knowledge about Out Run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/tree/master/agent/game"><code>game</code></a> package, which contains
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/game/action.py"><code>Action</code></a> enumeration: describes all the possible actions in the game.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/game/cannonball_wrapper.py"><code>cannonball_wrapper</code></a> module: only this module has access to the cannonball emulator. It translates the aforementioned actions into game actions and is accessed by methods such as <code>start_game()</code>, <code>reset()</code> and <code>speed()</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/trainer/episode.py#L56"><code>RewardCalculator</code></a> class: contains the reward function. Instead of using a generic reward function like DeepMind, it was chosen to have a tailor-made reward function for Out Run, which takes into account the car’s speed and its off-road and crash status.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/trainer/visualization/metrics.py"><code>metrics</code></a> module: aware of the <code>speed</code> metric, which is Out Run specific, and <code>score</code>, which is game specific domain knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Training another game would require the creation of a new wrapper with the same interface as <code>cannonball_wrapper</code>, a new <code>Action</code> enumerator specific to the game, a new <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/trainer/episode.py#L56"><code>RewardCalculator</code></a> with a different reward function and the removal/replacement of the <code>speed</code> metric.</p>

<p>Apart from the previously mentioned steps, solving generic problems would require the preprocessor to be changed/replaced if images were not to be used for state representation. An option would be to create a new preprocessor class with a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-trainer/blob/master/agent/trainer/image_preprocessor.py#L13"><code>process(input)</code></a> method, tweak the hyperparameters as required (so that the network knows which dimensions to expect on its input), and finally inject the newly created class in <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/agent-preprocessor/blob/master/agent/trainer/episode.py#L300"><code>EpisodeRunner</code></a>, replacing the old preprocessor class.</p>

<h2 id="further-references">Further references</h2>

<p>I am not a machine learning expert, but from my learner’s point of view, if you are interested in getting your feet wet, Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course is as a great starting point. It is freely available on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera online learning platform</a>. This was my first solid contact with the subject and served as a major stepping stone for related topics such as Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730">Udacity Google Deep Learning</a>: this free course tackles some of the popular deep learning techniques, all the while using tensorflow. I did this right after Andrew Ng’s course and found it to leave the student with less support during lessons - less hand-holding if you will - and as result I spent a good amount of time dabbling to reach a solution for the assignments. </p>

<p>As a side note, I started building this project by the end of the Deep Learning course, mostly because I wanted to apply and consolidate the concepts I learnt into something more practical and to share this knowledge further, so it could hopefully help more people who are interested in this.</p>

<title>Compressed Deque in Python</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/libraries/2016/08/27/compressed-deque.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/libraries/2016/08/27/compressed-deque.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This post aims to give some insights about a recently <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/compressed-deque">open-sourced</a> python deque which compresses its items for a decreased volatile and persistent memory footprint.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="why-how-can-it-be-useful">Why? How can it be useful?</h2>

<p>Compressed Deque came up while buiding an algorithm which relied on fast random accesses of numerous complex objects. When compressed, this blob of data could easily fit in fast volatile memory, as opposed to being fetched from a slow hard drive. Even though there was a performance penalty from compressing/decompressing items from volatile memory, this solution proved to be faster than accessing these items from indexed files on a hard disk (on a SSD the gains are more negligible though).</p>

<p>This collection might also be useful for programs running on devices with very limited memory available.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Compressed Deque inherits from <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque">deque</a> and stores its items as zlib compressed pickles. The middle pickle layer only serves as a generic serialization method which can provide a serialized object string for zlib to compress. Although pickle can compress objects, its compression rate does not match zlib’s, even using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format">higher protocols</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/compressed_deque/value_layers.png" /></p>

<p><code>save_to_file()</code> and <code>load_from_file()</code> static methods are provided to persist the collection directly into disk in its compressed representation, without much overhead. </p>

<p>The persisted file contains a sequence of header/compressed_value pairs: the header is a 4 byte integer description of the compressed value’s length and the compressed value is similiar to its in-memory representation.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/compressed_deque/persisted_values.png" /></p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use it</h2>

<p>An easy way to install this package is by using <code>pip</code>:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ pip install compressed-deque
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>You can then import the class and use it:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="include">compdeque</span> <span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="include">CompressedDeque</span>

<span class="comment"># Instantiate the Deque</span>
collection = CompressedDeque()

<span class="comment"># Use it as a normal deque</span>
collection.append(<span class="integer">1</span>)

<span class="comment"># Persist to a file</span>
CompressedDeque.save_to_file(collection, file_path=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">/path/to/collection.dat</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)

<span class="comment"># ...</span>

<span class="comment"># and load it when you need it later</span>
loaded_collection = CompressedDeque.load_from_file(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">/path/to/collection.dat</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<title>Attenuate GoPro Chest Mount Heartbeat - using GarageBand/iMovie</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/audio/2015/12/08/gopro-heartbeat.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/audio/2015/12/08/gopro-heartbeat.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you have a chest mount (chesty) for your GoPro, then you might have had the surprise of hearing your heartbeat on the recording, since it may lay fairly close to your heart, picking up its beat. This post will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show you how to attenuate the heartbeat sound to a point where it is almost imperceptible, while maintaining the overall sound</li>
  <li>attenuate the difference between quiet and loud sounds, so the listener gets less startled by a sudden noise created when entering with the bike on rought terrain or the common bike bell sound.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="steps-using-garagebandimovie">Steps, using GarageBand/iMovie</h2>

<p>In this specific case, GarageBand 10.0.3 and iMovie 10.0.5 were used, but other versions should work just as fine.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open iMovie
    <ol>
      <li>Import your GoPro file(s) into your iMovie project. This is the best point in time to edit them and arrange the movie to your liking</li>
      <li>Export your movie (File-&gt;Share-&gt;File…)
        <ul>
          <li>Open GarageBand</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Drag the exported movie into your GarageBand project
        <ul>
          <li>Decompress <a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/gopro_heartbeat/gopro_master_track.patch.zip">gopro_master_track.patch.zip</a> and copy <strong>gopro_master_track.patch</strong> to the “~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Patches/Output”</li>
          <li>Go to your Master Track (if you do not see it, click “Track-&gt;Show MasterTrack”) and click “User Patches” in your Library tab (if you do not see it, click “View-&gt;Show Library”)</li>
          <li>You should now see inside the “User Patches” the patch file we just copied, select it</li>
          <li><em>Your audio should now have an attenuated heartbeat and a more audible and balanced sound</em></li>
          <li>Export the audio (Share-&gt;Export to Disk). AIFF or MP3 will work great. I personally use the MP3 192kBit/s export, since the GoPro audio is not extra pristine to start with, so the tiny losses in compression are pretty much neglegible</li>
          <li>Go back to iMovie</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Remove the sound on your original GoPro video(s)
        <ul>
          <li>Drag the export audio from GarageBand, and place it below the video timeline</li>
          <li>Done!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-did-this-hopefully-worked-for-you">Why did this *hopefully* worked for you?</h2>

<p>The whole concept is very simple really, the heartbeat is simply being attenuated on specific frequencies by a Channel EQ plugin included in the above Master Track patch. This is how it looks visually:</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/gopro_heartbeat/heartbeat_channel_eq.png" /></p>

<p>This Channel EQ alone will turn this:</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/gopro_heartbeat/gopro_sample_with_heartbeat.mp3" /></audio>

<p>into this:</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="http://lopespm.github.io/files/gopro_heartbeat/gopro_sample_without_heartbeat.mp3" /></audio>

<p>And that is it! The rest of the plugins included on the Master Track Patch are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An additional Channel EQ that attenuates clicking sounds I heard along my videos</li>
  <li>Two compressors and a limiter which increase the overall loudness and diminish the difference between quiet and loud sounds</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="support-files">Support Files:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/gopro_heartbeat/gopro_master_track.patch.zip">Master Track Patch</a> (which includes all the above plugins)</li>
  <li><a href="http://lopespm.github.io/files/gopro_heartbeat/gopro_eq_heartbeat_attenuate.pst">Channel EQ preset</a> to attenuate the heartbeat sound. This can be used by opening a Channel EQ plugin in any of your tracks and clicking “More-&gt;Load..” inside it</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sczmkokpEuY">Example video</a> in which these plugins were applied</li>

<p>Add the <em>real world tested</em> <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized (dark/light)</a> Terminal profiles: <a href="https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized">https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>After cloning the repo, just open the profile files, which will add them to your Terminal.app preferences</li>
  <li>You can set them as the default profiles on your Terminal.app preferences</li>
  <li>To enable the terminal colors, add the line <code>export CLICOLOR=1</code> to your .bash_profile</li>
</ul>

<p>Grab the .bash_profile here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/lopespm/3877ff1ca4064a392686">https://gist.github.com/lopespm/3877ff1ca4064a392686</a>, which is heavily based on <a href="http://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/">Nathaniel Landau’s profile</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>In OSX, .bash_profile is executed <a href="http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html">everytime you open a new Terminal window</a>, and it lives in your user’s home directory, i.e. <code>~/.bash_profile</code></li>
  <li>If it does not exist, just <code>touch ~/.bash_profile</code> to create it</li>
  <li>If you do not want to clutter your .bash_profile, you can create a file like <code>~/scripts/utilities.bash</code> with the portions you find useful and then add this line to your .bash_profile: <code>source ~/scripts/utilities.bash</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully now your Terminal is even more inviting :)</p>

<title>Survival Ball on OUYA</title>
<link>http://lopespm.github.io/games/2013/09/08/survival-ball-ouya.html</link>
<guid>http://lopespm.github.io/games/2013/09/08/survival-ball-ouya.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Survival Ball in now available on OUYA, and its publishing process was fairly straightforward. From the day of submission (2nd of September) to its approval (5th of September), it took a mere 3 days, counting that a re-submission had to be made in-between.</p>

<p>Survival Ball was already available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalball">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RockByte-Software-Survival-Ball/dp/B00ARVZ7F0/ref=sr_1_1?s=mobile-apps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378394674&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon </a>and <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/rockbyte/survival-ball">Kongregate</a>, but OUYA just felt like the perfect platform for the game. With it, you could just grab the OUYA controller and/or a spare XBox/PS3 controller, and just have a quick match. I really loved the concept, and re-iterated on the previous version of the game to give it more controller friendly menus, better graphics, refined textures, and an overall revamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>After finishing up the port to OUYA, on the 2nd of September, I’ve made the first submission. I’ll just point out that upon this moment, it seemed to be stuck with a red status message which read “<em>Still verifying apk…</em>”. To resolve this, I edited the submission, re-submitted the APK, and waited a few seconds. The game was then submitted for approval.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, a re-submission was asked by the OUYA review team (which were very friendly by the way), since some elements fell of the safe-frame, which is safe-guard for gamers who have screens that perform <a href="https://devs.ouya.tv/developers/docs/content-review-guidelines">too much overscan</a>.</p>

<p>The game was re-submitted on the same day, and was approved on the 5th of September. From this point on, one can release the game whenever it seems more appropriate. The game was released on the same day.</p>

<p>I’ve came to learn during this process, after publishing the game, it first goes to the “Sandbox” section. Only after a major acceptance from the game community, can the game be promoted to the primary categories. So, if you would like to take a quick peek at the game, you can find it at the “Sandbox” section.</p>
