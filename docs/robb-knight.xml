<div> <p>tl;dr: You can't set full screen artwork without being featured by Apple.</p>
<p>In iOS17, the Apple Podcasts app has (for some shows) fancy new full screen artwork but I noticed that <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com">my</a> <a href="https://wegot.family">shows</a> don't.</p>
<p><img alt="We Got Family artwork vs Connected in Apple Podcasts app" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/full-screen-artwork.png" /></p>
<p>After some hunting around, some <a href="https://social.lol/@robb/111105291859489382">tooting</a>, and messaging <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@johnvoorhees">John</a>, I came across <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/866-promotional-artwork">this page</a> that outlines the full screen artwork. It explains the sizes for hero images, channel covers, and full page show art. It even has photoshop templates. My podcasts are unlikely to be featured but I figured it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>Once I made the art and hit the submit button, it turns out you can <em>only</em> submit hero images and if Apple then deems my show worthy enough for a feature will they then request the full page art.</p>
<p>This feels really shitty that you have to get featured just to get nicer artwork in the Apple Podcasts app which is far and away the most popular podcast app.</p> <div>

<title>I'm (Not) Building a Podcast Host</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/im-not-building-a-podcast-host/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/im-not-building-a-podcast-host/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Late last year I moved <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com">Ruminate</a> from Simplecast to it's <a href="https://rknight.me/bulding-podcast-site-eleventy/">own site built with Eleventy</a> for a two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted full control over how the site looked</li>
<li>Simplecast is $15 a month and that's a lot for a show that makes no money</li>
</ol>
<p>Since then, I've successfully used that same Eleventy site to build the site for <a href="https://wegot.family">We Got Family</a>, my Fast and Furious podcast. Having both my podcasts hosted myself has been great. I can automate uploads, extract the title and description from the file instead of having to copy and paste it into a CMS, and it costs me <em>basically</em> nothing.</p>
<p>One thing I am missing since I moved away from Simplecast is listener/download numbers. This is, in my opinion, the core selling feature of a dedicated podcast host. Each host does the calculations differently (and they all keep their methods secret) but they do all seem to at least attempt to follow this <em>thrilling</em> document titled <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf">&quot;Podcast Measurement Technical Guidelines Version 2.1&quot;</a>. There's some boring stuff in there about the poor advertisers who can't get the data they want and some talk about a new, yet-to-happen reporting feature from some apps but the part I care about is counting listens. The hard part of calculating downloads is parsing server logs: if someone listens in a browser, logs will show multiple partial downloads for that file so that should be counted as one listen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://docs.bunny.net/docs/cdn-log-format">Bunny has a very nice log format</a> that is easy enough to parse. A quick-and-dirty solution me and <a href="https://neatnik.net">Adam</a> came up with for counting a single listen is if the IP address, user agent, and file are the same within the same 24 hour period, count that as one listen. This isn't perfect by any means, but will be good enough for what I want.</p>
<p>This attempt at generating listen stats was partially research into an idea I've had running around in my head for at least a year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you build a podcast host for smaller podcasts like mine for, say, $20 a year?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accounts, uploading files, hosting websites, is all easy enough but when you consider download costs the answer, after going over some calculations with <a href="https://zoeaubert.me">Zoe</a>, is no. The file egress costs (the cost of downloading the files from a CDN) is too high even for a small show.</p>
<p>Update: I got the calculations wrong here for Bunny's pricing so it <em>might</em> still be viable as a product although the margins are still tight.</p>
<p>As an example, if a show has a 30mb episode and that show gets 500 downloads, that's ~15gb of egress. On <a href="https://bunny.net">BunnyCDN</a> that would cost somewhere in the region of $1.50. AWS S3 is about the same. Assuming one episode a month (unlikely), that's pretty close to $20 a year.</p>
<p>These calculations don't even take into account older episodes getting more downloads over time (they definitely will) or the show growing over time (it likely will). What about if someone decides to <a href="https://rknight.me/three-years-of-hemispheric-views-feedback/">listen to all 74 episodes of a show at once</a> leading to 2-3gb of downloads in one go?</p>
<p>There is an argument to be made that variable pricing might work: pay $X per year then monthly pay whatever the CDN cost for your show is but this feels counter-intuitive to building a simple podcast host. I could charge a similar amount as some of the existing services but then I'm not bringing anything new to the table.</p>
<p>Ultimately every solution to the cost problem goes against my initial idea. Instead, I'm going to focus some time on making my Eleventy podcast site more usable for other people to deploy their own podcasts.</p>

<title>Fundraising for St Jude</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/st-jude-2023/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/st-jude-2023/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This year is <a href="https://relay.experience.stjude.org">Relay FM's 5th annual fundraiser</a> for <a href="https://www.stjude.org">St Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>. If you don't know St Jude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mission of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family’s ability to pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their goal this year is to hit $2.5 <em>million</em> lifetime donations. As part of that individuals, like me, can set up their own campaign which is <a href="https://rknight.me/stjude">exactly what I've done</a>.</p>
<p>I set a milestone of $150 at which point I will watch all 99 minutes of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2933474/">Superfast!</a>, a Fast and Furious parody movie which I definitely do not want to watch in any way. That milestone has been hit already so keep an eye out on the <a href="https://wegot.family">We Got Family podcast</a> feed for an episode about it.</p>
<p>My original goal was $250 but <a href="https://adam.omg.lol">Adam of omg.lol</a> kindly donated the entire amount in one go. Then he went one step further and commited to donating 50% of profits from omg.lol for the <em>entire month</em>. So if you're an omg.lol member (or you <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">sign up</a> for a new account) and you renew your address you're donating to the campaign.</p>
<p>We also have two omg.lol codes up for grabs: anyone who donates $10 or more will be entered to win a five year code and whoever donates the most will win an ultra-rare lifetime code.</p>
<p>I have moved the goal to <s>$3000</s> <s>$5000</s> $10000 and as generous as Adam is being, I don't want it to all come from him so if you can donate anything, even a dollar, it all helps towards an amazing cause.</p>
<p><a href="https://rknight.me/stjude">Donate to the campaign here</a></p>

<title>It’s Better in the App and Other Lies</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/its-better-in-the-app-and-other-lies/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/its-better-in-the-app-and-other-lies/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I've seen a few conversations on Mastodon the last week or so about why we have so many apps rather than decent mobile websites and why we're shown &quot;things are better in the app!&quot; banners (and who's fault is that website?!). I've been thinking about this on and off for a <a href="https://social.lol/@robb/110588163612894889">long time</a>. I don't like that Apple hold all the keys to distrubting an app and I'm a big fan of the open web. I do beleive there are good reasons for native apps in some cases (specifically native features not available in browsers) but not <em>everything</em> needs an app. I think there are three different reasons this is happening so much.</p>
<h3>Gobbling data</h3>
<p>This is the obvious one. It's a lot easier to collect data from a native app than it is from a website. On an app I have very little control over what requests are made, blocking ads, that kind of thing. So of course companies want to use apps to collect this data.</p>
<h3>Making money</h3>
<p>This one applies more to indie developers than it does to big companies but I'm certain people are more willing to pay for an app than access to a website. As an example, <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2023/8/7/callsheet">Callsheet</a> <em>could</em> be a website but would people pay $9 a year for a website? I don't think they would.</p>
<h3>People want apps</h3>
<p>This last one is at least a little bit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg">on Apple with their &quot;there's an app for that&quot; ad</a>. A few years ago I ordered a washing machine from <a href="https://ao.com">AO</a> and if I was on mobile the only way to track my order was to download their brand new tracking app. I contacted them about this and I was told they made the app because lots of customers were asking for it.</p>
<p>Just think about that for a second: people want to download an app just to track deliveries of their white goods, something which most people order at most once a year. This is bonkers to me. They did eventually fix the deep link so you could track from the website on mobile.</p>
<p>In some instances it's become impossible to do certain things on mobile because the app doesn't support the feature (for example, buying ebooks on Amazon) but I never get redirected back out</p>

<title>Just Delete Me: Ten Years Later</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/just-delete-me-ten-years-later/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/just-delete-me-ten-years-later/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ten years ago <a href="https://www.edpoole.me/">Ed Poole</a> and I <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/369368988762906626/">launched Just Delete Me</a>. Just Delete Me, as I <a href="https://rknight.me/just-delete-me/">described it at the time</a>, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a directory of urls to delete your account from web services</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote three blog posts in first ten days which you can read here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rknight.me/just-delete-me/">Just Delete Me</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rknight.me/24-hours-of-just-delete-me/">24 Hours of Just Delete Me</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rknight.me/just-delete-me-one-million-page-views/">JustDelete.me: One Million Page Views</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As I recall we made it over the course of one Sunday afternoon and launched it the day after. The first day it had a decent amount of visitors (~3000) and then seemingly overnight it got picked up everywhere, including some huge sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mashable.com/archive/justdelete-me">Mashable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/just-delete-me/">Wired</a></li>
<li><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/08/just-delete-me-how-to-delete-your-account-on-amazon-netflix-skype-et-al.html">Slate</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/how-to-delete-your-web-accounts-with-justdelete-me/">CNET</a></li>
<li><a href="https://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/59537088319/futurejournalismproject-delete-yourself-from">Neil Gaiman</a> reblogged it on his Tumblr</li>
</ul>
<p>We spent the next week or two frantically merging pull requests for new sites, going from the 16 we started with to over 100 in a very short space of time. We hit one million page views within nine days of launching and I was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal and a BBC radio station (I don't remember which one nor do I have the recording).</p>
<p>A few days after this I added a service to the site and marked it as difficult to delete, then tweeted about it. Within hours I got an email from their CEO (I won't name him but I will say maybe he had a day phone and a night phone) who was annoyed we had marked them as such and wanted to know what he could do to change that. To the best of my knowledge, they never actually did anything about it.</p>
<p>The only way to contribute to the site was to open a pull request on Github which wasn't great for non-developers so I set up a Google form to collect suggestions and links. We got so many pull requests I completely forgot about the form for a couple of months. When I did remember about it and logged in to have a look I was genuinely surprised to see there was thousands of submissions but most of them weren't suggestions for sites. There was hundreds of submissions that included peoples usernames and passwords for various sites (<em>loads</em> of Facebook ones) because they thought the form was a way to get <em>me</em> to delete their accounts. I promptly deleted that form and the associated sheet, I did not want to be responsible for that data.</p>
<p>Thanks to contributors the site eventually had translations into 20 or so languages and grew to have 476 sites listed at the time I sold it. At some stage in the first few months we put Google ads on the site (gross) and it paid my, admittedly small, rent for the next 2 years (not gross).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the person I sold it to let it go stagnant (turns out they just wanted the domain) but someone forked the project, put it up on a new domain (<a href="https://justdeleteme.xyz/">https://justdeleteme.xyz/</a>) and continued adding sites. It now has over 1500 sites and services listed. This forked project also spun off two other projects based on the same premise: <a href="https://justgetmydata.com">Just Get My Data</a> and <a href="https://justwhatsthedata.github.io/">Just What's The Data</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of the site was built with <s>hopes, dreams, and duct tape</s> a makefile and a whole lot of json files. If I was going to make this exact site today it would be significantly easier with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> data files and I could probably avoid a lot of the merge conflicts we had in the early days with a better data structure. I also definitely wouldn't put Google ads on the site.</p>
<p>Just Delete Me is still my most popular project at least in terms of page views, although the <a href="https://potimages.rknight.me/">Monzo Pot Image Generator</a> has definitely been more consistent in terms of visits (and ~55k images generated).</p>
<p>Here's every link I collected about the site back then. Given it's been 10 years I'm guessing a lot of these are dead now.</p>

<title>Compiling CSS with Eleventy</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/compiling-css-with-eleventy/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/compiling-css-with-eleventy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yesterday I <a href="https://social.lol/@robb/110894030545897361">asked on Mastodon</a> what methods people are using for compiling CSS with Eleventy. It's been a while since I've need anything more than a single stylesheet but since I keep adding various things to my site, the stylesheet has got a bit unweildy. I'll admit, I know very little about the various css libraries and tools (the last time I did this I used Gulp which tells you how long ago that was) so I was coming to this with basically no knowledge. My basic requirements were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile multiple CSS files into one</li>
<li>Minify the CSS</li>
<li>Keep everything in Eleventy. I don't want to have to manage additional libraries and scripts outside the Eleventy build step.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PostCSS</h3>
<p>The first response was <a href="https://social.lol/@jgarber@mastodon.cc/110894115168581629">Jason</a> with his method of <a href="https://github.com/jgarber623/refresh-dc.org/blob/main/lib/plugins/postcss.js">using PostCSS</a> with the <code>easy-import</code> and <code>nesting</code> plugin. This is a nice solution and I have used <a href="https://postcss.org">PostCSS</a> a little bit in the past. <a href="https://martinschneider.me/articles/generating-css-with-postcss-and-eleventy-before/">Martin Schneider has a nice blog post</a> about using PostCSS before the site is built so they can inline and purge the CSS.</p>
<h3>Read the fucking manual</h3>
<p>David Darnes came at me with a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>. Turns out Eleventy has a <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/custom/#example-add-sass-support-to-eleventy">page on the docs for doing exactly this</a>. This method uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass">Sass</a> and requires a little bit of config. One thing to note is by default this will output <em>all</em> <code>.scss</code> file to the built site, so I added a check to see if the file is named <code>app</code> and if it's not, then skip it. Alternatively you can put your files in an <code>_includes</code> directory and these won't be output (thanks Dave). <code>style: 'compressed'</code> will minimise the CSS.</p>

<h3>LightningCSS</h3>
<p>I hadn't heard of <a href="https://lightningcss.dev">LightningCSS</a> until yesterday but it's a &quot;CSS parser, transformer, bundler, and minifier&quot; built with Rust. <a href="https://thinkdobecreate.com/">Stephanie Eckles</a> has an <a href="https://github.com/5t3ph/eleventy-plugin-lightningcss">Eleventy plugin</a> for using LightningCSS which handles all the configuration and as a bonus ignores any files that start with <code>_</code> so they won't get copied to the build folder.</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// .eleventy.js</span><br /><span class="token keyword">const</span> lightningCSS <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"@11tyrocks/eleventy-plugin-lightningcss"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><br />module<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function-variable function">exports</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">eleventyConfig</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />  eleventyConfig<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">addPlugin</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>lightningCSS<span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Ultimately I like how simple this is to add to my existing site without any additonal configuration so I think this is the way I'm going to go.</p>

<title>Block ChatGPT and other AI Bots with robots.txt</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/block-chatgpt-with-robotstxt/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/block-chatgpt-with-robotstxt/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A <code>robots.txt</code> file &quot;tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site&quot;. Generally one would use this to tell a search engine which directories should be crawled, which ones shouldn't, or to completely block from crawling your site. The file lives at the root of your site. You can <a href="https://rknight.me/robots.txt">see mine here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> has two user agents that might attempt to crawl your site: <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot"><code>GPTBot</code></a> and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/chatgpt-user"><code>ChatGPT-User</code></a>. To disallow crawling from both of these, we can set our <code>robots.txt</code> file like so:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">User-agent: GPTBot<br />Disallow: /<br /><br />User-agent: ChatGPT-User<br />Disallow: /</code></pre>
<p>Update 2023-09-29: <a href="https://neil-clarke.com/block-the-bots-that-feed-ai-models-by-scraping-your-website/">Neil Clarke has a great post</a> with some additional bots that should be blocked:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">User-agent: CCBot<br />Disallow: /<br /><br />User-agent: Google-Extended<br />Disallow: /<br /><br />User-agent: Omgilibot<br />Disallow: /</code></pre>
<h3>Adding a robots.txt file to Eleventy</h3>
<p>Using Eleventy's <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/copy/">passthrough file copy</a> we can create a <code>robots.txt</code> file and then add the following to our Eleventy config to make sure the file is copied to your built site:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">addPassthroughCopy</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'robots.txt'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you can do this with just a file and a permalink:</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">---<br />permalink: robots.txt<br />eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true<br />---<br /><br />// user agents here</code></pre>
<p>And there we go. ChatGPT, in theory, should be blocked from crawling our site.</p>

<title>Three Years of Hemispheric Views Feedback</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/three-years-of-hemispheric-views-feedback/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/three-years-of-hemispheric-views-feedback/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently started listening to the <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com/">Hemispheric Views</a> podcast and decided I would go back to the start and listen to the 74 previous episodes that I hadn't listened to. I wrote down <em>all</em> my feedback. I started this endevour on the 17th of May and finished the last episode this morning. <a href="https://grepjason.sh/">Jason</a> agreed to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will take any feedback, 3 years old or otherwise haha</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In total I listened to just over 58 hours of main show and over ten hours of the one prime plus dot com member show. About ten episodes in I started singing the theme song to Baby Knight.</p>
<h3>Main Show</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/desk-2023.jpg">Roast my desk please</a></li>
<li>001 Jason tried Vegemite, has he tried marmite?</li>
<li>002 Martins “Game Boy micro USB” joke wasn’t acknowledged as it should have been</li>
<li>003 Did Jason ever develop the 1926 camera film?</li>
<li>004 Halloween is the worst &quot;holiday&quot;</li>
<li>009 Of course the week starts on Monday, anything else is mayhem</li>
<li>009 I watched an episode of <a href="https://youtu.be/Fahf77qzEnE">Bargearse</a> and it was glorious</li>
<li>010 I love picking a random movie that's on TV when I’m away in a hotel or something but never do it at home</li>
<li>010 One of favourite bands <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7bnFPaGnkc">covered the Round the Twist theme song</a></li>
<li>011 Andrew is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsj2-dWf1ko">briefcase wanker</a></li>
<li>012 Gabriel’s <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/poe-s-x-wing-fighter-75102">Orange Lego X-Wing</a> is canon</li>
<li>014 What the hell is with Australian nature</li>
<li>014 I would die for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vIaCXCkkrs">the Gobbledok</a></li>
<li>014 “Nissan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter">Iambic pentameter</a>” 👏</li>
<li>016 Andrew hasn’t seen Batman and Robin?! He should rectify that</li>
<li>016 <a href="https://rknight.me/building-a-pisight/">I put a Raspberry Pi camera in an iSight</a></li>
<li>017 &quot;Double digit coffee action&quot; would be a good band name</li>
<li>019 My partner spent years using ~$10 headphones. When I gave her my good ones, she was blown away at how good music can sound</li>
<li>020 Screw it, I’m making my own asset deprecation spreadsheet</li>
<li>020 Sealed triangle toastie is the best toastie type</li>
<li>022 Alex makes the media corner theme tune, a few years later he’s in Eurovision. Suspicious.</li>
<li>022 The premise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackerjack_(2002_film)">Crackerjack</a> sounds identical to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337879/">Blackball</a></li>
<li>022 “Perthsuaded” I hate this</li>
<li>023 “<em>There still isn’t a good email app on iOS</em>” - Andrew. This is because email is bad, stop looking for your own sanity</li>
<li>023 “Everything surrounding email is wrong”</li>
<li>023 <a href="https://rknight.me/micro/110361312690891868/">Here’s my homescreen</a></li>
<li>023 I wish Apple would allow apps to be anywhere on the Home Screen too. Please Tim Apple.</li>
<li>023 I have 203 apps installed</li>
<li>025 Is Andrew still using the johnny decimal system?</li>
<li>027 Game preservation is why I’ve tried as best I can to only buy physical games - currently I have around <a href="https://rknight.me/collections/games">300 across a bunch of consoles</a></li>
<li>028 A few years ago we built a <a href="http://knockoffia.devsdodesign.com">Nokia 3310 simulator</a> in the browser</li>
<li>029 I wear shoes in the house, life is too short</li>
<li>031 I wear the same black socks all year round, regardless of jeans or shorts. All my socks are identical so I don’t have to pair them up. I say no to funny socks</li>
<li>031 Perhaps there’s a market for discounted once-used socks, then Jason could have new socks every day</li>
<li>031 This is more than I ever needed to know about air conditioning</li>
<li>033 I also love going to grocery stores in other countries</li>
<li>033 I laughed at Andrew’s joke about going to Cloud 9</li>
<li>034 My neighbour works at the Office of National Statistics and it sounds fascinating</li>
<li>034 I’ve never seen rocky road with Turkish delight. That sounds incredible.</li>
<li>036 I spat my drink out at “FinderJimbo”</li>
<li>038 “Clean show”? Jason has definitely sworn on at least 4 episodes</li>
<li>038 Movies our spouses don’t like? My partner refuses to watch any Fast and Furious movie despite the fact that <a href="https://wegot.family">I love them</a></li>
<li>038 TODAY!</li>
<li>039 I know my neighbours now but didn’t at my last house that I lived at for 10 years. I did what Jason did when we moved and drew a map with names of everyone. It helped that we moved in around Christmas so everyone sent cards with their names</li>
<li>040 I am furious Andrew doesn’t use “Grand Canion” as a username everywhere because that is so fucking good</li>
<li>040 Pen licence! I never actually got mine because my writing was (and still is) terrible, I outlasted them until year 4 when everyone had to use a pen anyway</li>
<li>042 Right at the start Jason swears and isn’t bleeped and then immediately after in the same sentence he is bleeped. No notes, just amused</li>
<li>042 That stupid EA Sports intro in burned into my brain from play FIFA World Cup ‘98 on the N64. Immediately after Song 2 by Blur would play so it wasn’t all bad</li>
<li>044 Never say “state daddy” again</li>
<li>044 Fruit Loops is a garbage cereal. Lucky Charms all the way</li>
<li>044 Andrew said the milk on the box looked too white and creamy. That’s because they usually use paint or PVA glue for milk in food photography</li>
<li>045 I couldn’t use just spotlight. I have so many <a href="https://rknight.me/alfred-workflows/">workflows</a> I use in Alfred</li>
<li>046 The shuffling albums on Spotify drama with Adele was so stupid</li>
<li>046 One arcade machine for my house? Time Crisis 2</li>
<li>046 It’s 7am here and a breakfast lasagne sounds amazing</li>
<li>046 What happened to <a href="https://decimeal.com/">Decimeal</a></li>
<li>049 “<em>I don’t know if anyone does this but go back to the beginning of the RSS archive, apparently people have other things to do</em>” - Martin</li>
<li>049 The formal intro thing is unsettling</li>
<li>050 What on earth was all this Dolly Parton talk?!</li>
<li>051 I hadn’t considered the comparison to Dharma for Severance but that is an excellent observation</li>
<li>051 🛎️ More Dolly Parton</li>
<li>051 I watched Severance in one night until 6am while sleep-deprived when Baby Knight was born. It definitely gave it a different vibe</li>
<li>052 Another recommendation for Punk Rock Factory: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbul4f8AX8">We Don't Talk About Bruno cover</a></li>
<li>053 The people saying sorry too much thing is a problem in the UK as well, I hate it</li>
<li>054 I refuse to listen to podcasts that have dynamically inserted ads</li>
<li>054 I have a disappearing dock and like it. Sorry Natasha</li>
<li>055 My MX Master works fine on Bluetooth</li>
<li>057 Martin on Elon buying Twitter “<em>I’m cautiously optimistic that something really useful will happen and it will change for the better</em>”</li>
<li>058 My entrance music would be <a href="https://song.link/s/0q6Qyd2QaHMHp7APKyQsyi">Not the Same by Bodyjar</a> because it’s a banger</li>
<li>059 I’m scared to do bad show notes lest I feel the wrath of Jason</li>
<li>061 I have my school yearbook but I never look at it</li>
<li>061 Perfect foods: pizza, spaghetti bolognese, donor kebab with lettuce and garlic sauce</li>
<li>061 “Feld tip” 👀</li>
<li>063 This was an excellent discussion about podcasts</li>
<li>064 I refuse to believe it's pronounced ex-mouth</li>
<li>064 This business corner was incredible</li>
<li>065 I guessed the bus story was fake</li>
<li>068 wtf was that Cappuccino talk</li>
<li>069 We have Nobby’s nuts here too</li>
<li>069 You’re making me want a Play Date</li>
<li>069 My top five movies:
<ul>
<li>Back to the Future (I even have a Back to the Future tattoo)</li>
<li>Hot Fuzz</li>
<li>Baby Driver</li>
<li>Captain America: Winter Soldier</li>
<li>Straight Outta Compton</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>070 Benji said he doesn’t like the yellow bit of eggs. Notable.</li>
<li>070 “<em>Be more negative</em>” - Benji</li>
<li>072 Martin will hate this sign from a UK chain where <a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-a-poundland-store-sign-71740740.html?imageid=1F597E32-BEC1-46FC-9C74-1CCCBC895D64&amp;p=179593&amp;pn=1&amp;searchId=8798bbaa288a340a187eb179f2e6aaea&amp;searchtype=0">“everyday” should be two words</a></li>
<li>074 My favourite photos from 2022:</li>

<li>06 This number plate story is wonderful</li>
<li>06 In the UK we didn’t line dance at school, but we did <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance">Morris Dance</a></li>

<title>Fix for Low Volume Exported Audio in GarageBand</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yesterday <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@mikestreety/110685303152811714">Mike pointed out</a> that the pilot episode of <a href="https://wegot.family/0">my new podcast</a> was quiet compared to other shows. I opened up the project files in GarageBand and couldn't see anything that would be causing this so I started hunting around in the settings. It turns out the &quot;Export projects at full volume&quot; was causing this. I don't know what this setting is supposed to do but I turned it off, exported the episode again, and it was fixed.</p>

<title>A Threads Thread Blog Post</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/a-threads-thread-blog-post/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/a-threads-thread-blog-post/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I wanted to expand a bit on my <a href="https://social.lol/@robb/110665866974743896">Threads thread</a> so instead of adding to the thread, I've written a blog post about Threads. Clear? Good.</p>
<p>The Mastodon blog has <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/">a good post about Threads</a> and what it means for the fediverse in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that large platforms are adopting ActivityPub is not only validation of the movement towards decentralized social media, but a path forward for people locked into these platforms to switch to better providers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no intention of using Threads, signing up was purely an academic exercise. I'm not even going to link to my profile but if you happen to find me, I'll be posting random emojis when I remember the app exists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Threads shows me a load of crap from people I don’t follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said &quot;as expected&quot; in my Mastodon post but I'm not sure I'd actually thought about this. <em>Of course</em> they were going to dump random stuff into the timeline. And <em>of course</em> this will include ads/promoted posts in the future. I wonder if they intend to inject ads into a persons timeline when they support ActivityPub so even if you follow from Mastodon you see ads (until I immediately unfollow them). We shall see.</p>
<p>The app does that awful refresh like Instagram does when you open the app, start reading something, then it’s gone, never to be seen again. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@CTD/110665895008825097">CTD said</a> they have muscle memory to favourite posts on Instagram when it opens just in case this happens? That is <em>wild</em> that people feel the need to do that just because the app sucks. Now we have two apps that suck like that.</p>
<p>Speaking of ActivityPub, they say it's coming, it's mentioned in help docs but I agree with <a href="https://social.lol/@andyn/110665801776694098">Andy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it either won’t happen at all, or won’t happen for a long time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made a <a href="https://rknight.me/building-an-activitypub-server/">basic ActivityPub server a few weeks ago</a> and while it doesn't implement everything that ActivityPub has to offer, it's close enough. I'm surprised a company the size of Meta, who has a huge team of engineers couldn't get this working for launch. To be clear I'm not saying &quot;herp derp I did it why can't they&quot; but still, I find it surprising. If we don't see it within a month, I think we might never see it.</p>
<p>Assuming they <em>do</em> release AP support, I <em>am</em> excited for that. Being able to follow people who will never join Mastodon sounds great. I don't want to use Threads (much like Bluesky) just to follow a handful of people. Here's hoping they <em>do</em> release it and that they don't inject ads into a user's posts.</p>

<title>Custom Sidebar Icons in Finder</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/custom-sidebar-icons-in-finder/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/custom-sidebar-icons-in-finder/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="Custom icons in the Finder" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/custom-icons.png" /></p>
<p>MacOS customisation is basically dead. Plenty of apps that used to work, no longer do. You can still have custom folder icons which is nice but I wanted custom sidebar icons for those folders, like <a href="https://rknight.me/micro/110615734381939778/">the developer one</a>.</p>
<p>I started googling around trying to find something for recent versions of MacOS and the only thing I found was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/seig87/how_to_make_custom_finder_sidebar_icons_big_sur/">this Reddit post</a> outlining a method to do it with PNGs. Between me and <a href="https://www.keiransell.com">Keir</a> we were able to make it work not only with any standard <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/">SF Symbol</a> but custom made ones as well.</p>
<p>You'll need Xcode installed to do this but the instructions relatively simple. I will say it's <em>really</em> flaky when building, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it just shows a random icon instead. All of the instructions are on <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/custom-finder-sidebar-icons">the GitHub repository</a> including some dandy screencasts from Keir.</p>

<title>Building an ActivityPub Server</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/building-an-activitypub-server/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/building-an-activitypub-server/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To start with, I'm not convinced everything I've done here is exactly to the ActivityPub specification or if there will be problems interacting with Bugle on various ActivityPub servers outside the main ones (Mastodon, Calckey, etc). I'm also unclear on which parts of this are Mastodon-specific and which parts are pure ActivityPub. I will use Mastodon as the example external server throughout.</p>
<p>I won't go over setting up my database or server for this but at minimum you'll need a way to handle requests, render JSON, and a database to store posts and activities.</p>
<h3>WebFinger and Profile JSON</h3>
<p>This is the easiest part of the whole thing, two JSON files: <code>.well-known/webfinger</code> and <code>@bugle.json</code>.</p>
<p><code>.well-known/webfinger</code> is how ActivityPub finds links to your profile. Searching for <code>@bugle@bugle.lol</code> on Mastodon, for example, will send a <code>GET</code> request to <code>https://bugle.lol/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:bugle@bugle.lol</code> which will return the following:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br /><br />  <span class="token property">"subject"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"acct:bugle@bugle.lol"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  <span class="token property">"links"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><br />    <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />      <span class="token property">"rel"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"self"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />      <span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"application/activity+json"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />      <span class="token property">"href"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle"</span><br />    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><br />  <span class="token punctuation">]</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The server handles checking if the requested <code>resource</code> exists and returning the correct data. The <code>links</code> part is how it knows the account lives at <code>bugle.lol/@bugle</code>. This might seems obvious but it isn't always the case that the username match the domain where the profile lives. For example, the profile for <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci">viticci@macstories.net</a> is actually at <code>mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci</code>, which is indicated by the webfinger.</p>
<p>Once Mastodon has the link, it will make a request to that link (in this case <code>https://bugle.lol/@bugle</code>) for the profile json file which includes general profile information like name, avatar, and bio, as well as which endpoints it should send requests to. These are usually called an inbox although the actually name and path isn't important.</p>
<p>You can see a full example on <a href="https://social.lol/@robb.json">my Mastodon profile</a> but I'll go through the main important parts here. The first part is the <code>@context</code>, which as best I can tell it an indicator of the type of object(?) we're defining, in this case an activity stream.</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><br /><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />	<span class="token property">"@context"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><br />	    <span class="token string">"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	    <span class="token string">"https://w3id.org/security/v1"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">]</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>The next part is an ID to identify your user, a type to define that this is a <code>Person</code>, and endpoints for various features, some of which are Mastodon-specific (like <code>featured</code> and <code>featuredTags</code>).</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />	<span class="token property">"id"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Person"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"following"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle/following"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"followers"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle/followers"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"inbox"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle/inbox"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"outbox"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle/outbox"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"featured"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle/collections/featured"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"featuredTags"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle/collections/tags"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"endpoints"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />	    <span class="token property">"sharedInbox"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/inbox"</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not entirely sure when most of these are used aside from when first searching for a profile (because I see the requests in the logs) but the important ones here are <code>inbox</code> and <code>endpoints.sharedInbox</code>. This is where replies and mentions will get posted to (<code>sharedInbox</code>) and activities such as likes, follows, and boosts (<code>inbox</code>). I'll go into how that works further down.</p>
<p>We also need information about the profile itself like name, bio, profile picture, and so on. The <code>icon</code> attributes refer to your main profile image and <code>image</code> refers to a header image.</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />	<span class="token property">"name"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"bugle dot lol"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"summary"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"&lt;p>A bio goes here&lt;/p>\n"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"url"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"manuallyApprovesFollowers"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"discoverable"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"published"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"icon"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />		<span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Image"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"mediaType"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"image/jpeg"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"url"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"http://placekitten.com/200/300"</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"image"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />		<span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Image"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"mediaType"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"image/jpeg"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"url"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"http://placekitten.com/600/300"</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">}</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally we need a <code>publicKey</code> attribute. This is used to validate requests to and from the server:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token property">"publicKey"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />		<span class="token property">"id"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle#main-key"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"owner"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://bugle.lol/@bugle"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"publicKeyPem"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAyB9YyNt5OB23VW3sFm5o\nPnV4phqSXgqwyqmjXIE6ZtwLE0I6JEeeqv+SD2pd9QDXiUfugEWuUyNImZCglNg2\nV3Vh/NNr/YX6tWW6VSkudJ/b8lNQF8Rr/Z9wK9jD0WUmFs+YjS0R/KePDtLt1HOX\nVfjPLyOCODO+ykXQkydLI1RZf3V+iJdiTP9e5nhBxQGHkbyVja/86uqJIC96zyX4\nQPteEtHjXngVgO6QozCQu6Null4WFOHUdPGHaN7wsJtkZV10BPp3yCOiirJQlXSp\no+7YfJuROFv8QU+jWitTPTYWQYEuRwUfDUsdThqSh/u6eZt2hHjTzcI0/qgpxWqI\n1wIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span></code></pre>
<p>You can generate these in most languages. Here's how I did it in PHP on profile creation to store in the database:</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$config</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><br />	<span class="token string double-quoted-string">"private_key_bits"</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token number">2048</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token string double-quoted-string">"private_key_type"</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token constant">OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token variable">$keypair</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">openssl_pkey_new</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$config</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token function">openssl_pkey_export</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$keypair</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token variable">$private_key</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token variable">$public_key</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">openssl_pkey_get_details</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$keypair</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token variable">$public_key</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token variable">$public_key</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string double-quoted-string">"key"</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<h3>Receiving Activities</h3>
<p>As mentioned above there are two endpoints for receiving activities: The global inbox (<code>/inbox</code>) and the user inbox (<code>/@bugle/inbox</code>).</p>
<h3>Validating Requests</h3>
<p>All signature validation is handled in my <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/bugle/blob/main/app/Services/HttpSignature.php"><code>HttpSignature</code> class</a> if you'd prefer to look at the code directly.</p>
<p>Every request that comes in should be validated against the signature to make sure it's a valid request. The first step is to extract the values into an array keyed by the name (other languages and frameworks might have an easier way to do this).</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$values</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token comment">// split the signature at ',' and assign each one</span><br /><span class="token comment">// to $values, keyed by its name</span><br /><span class="token variable">$parts</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">explode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string single-quoted-string">','</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token variable">$request</span><span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token function">header</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string single-quoted-string">'signature'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token keyword">foreach</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$parts</span> <span class="token keyword">as</span> <span class="token variable">$current</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />	<span class="token variable">$pair</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">explode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string single-quoted-string">'='</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token variable">$current</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />	<span class="token variable">$key</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token variable">$pair</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />	<span class="token variable">$value</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">substr</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$pair</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />	<span class="token variable">$values</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token variable">$key</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token variable">$value</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span><br /><br /><span class="token comment">// $values is now:</span><br /><span class="token comment">// [</span><br /><span class="token comment">//    'keyId' => 'https://mas.to/users/rknightuk#main-key',</span><br /><span class="token comment">//    'algorithm' => 'rsa-sha256',</span><br /><span class="token comment">//    'headers' => ''(request-target) host date digest content-type',</span><br /><span class="token comment">//    'signature' => 'BIGLONGSIGNATURE',</span><br /><span class="token comment">// ];</span></code></pre>
<p>Next we need to get the <code>headers</code> value from the signature, and map over those, get the values from the request headers, and generate a string. This string is what we use to validate the request:</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$inboxPath</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'/@bugle/inbox'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token variable">$headerList</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token

<p>One thing to note here is if you set different inbox URLs for user and for local, then you need to specific which path you're validating for (either <code>/inbox</code> or <code>/@bugle/inbox</code>) otherwise the signatures won't match.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to fetch the public key for the actor, and use that to validate the request:</p>

<p>If <code>isValid</code> is true, we can carry on and accept requests. You should do this for all requests that come into the inboxes.</p>
<h3>Likes, Boosts, and Follows</h3>
<p>The user inbox will <code>POST</code> requests for follows, likes, and boosts. Likes and boosts are easy enough to handle as you don't need to respond to the request or even store them if you don't want to. A like is the simplest of the two. It contains an ID of the like, the type of activity, the actor, and the object - this is the post that has been liked.</p>

<p>Boosts are similar, but they also include <code>to</code> and <code>cc</code> arrays of users the post is being boosted to, as well as a <code>published_at</code> date.</p>

<p>Follow events are more complicated because they require a response. A follow activity will look something like this:</p>

<p>To respond to a follow, we need to send an <code>Accept</code> activity with a valid signature. To start with we need to build our activity message; it has an ID, type, actor (the user being followed) and an <code>object</code> which in this case, is the <code>Follow</code> activity we received.</p>

<p>If someone unfollows you, you'll receive an <code>Undo</code> request. Check the <code>actor</code> on that request and you can then remove them from your followers table.</p>

If you have a server with multiple profiles, you can map over the <code>object.cc</code> array to find matching profiles for your domain.</p>
<p>As a bonus here, unrelated to ActivityPub, I setup <a href="https://ntfy.sh/">https://ntfy.sh/</a> to send me notifications whenever I get a reply:</p>

<h3>Formatting Posts</h3>
<p>The post's content needs to be rendered to HTML. Bugle supports writing in Markdown so I use <a href="https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark"><code>league/commonmark</code></a> to format the content for sending to followers. I also extract @mentions to generate links in the posts and add them to <code>tags</code> on the post JSON. See <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/bugle/blob/main/app/Services/TootFormatter.php"><code>TootFormatter</code></a> for the full implementation.</p>
<p>A post that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="language-md"><code class="language-md">This toot has <span class="token url">[<span class="token content">a link</span>](<span class="token url">https://example.com</span>)</span> and a mention: @robb@social.lol ahoy!</code></pre>
<p>Is run through the formatter:</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$content</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'This toot has

<p>And the <code>tags</code>, which we'll use later to determine who to notify of a mention, look like this:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />		<span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Mention"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"href"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://social.lol/@robb"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />		<span class="token property">"name"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"@robb@social.lol"</span><br />	<span class="token punctuation">}</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">]</span></code></pre>
<h3>Notifying Followers about New Posts</h3>
<p>Unlike RSS where new posts can be fetched into a feed ActivityPub requires all followers are notified of new posts by the originating server. Here's an example payload to notify followers of a new post.</p>

<p>The <code>type</code> attribute has three possible values that I'm using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Create</code> - to notify of a new post</li>
<li><code>Delete</code> - to delete an existing post</li>
<li><code>Update</code> - to update an existing post after an edit. Mastodon (and I assume others) require the <code>updated</code> timestamp for a <code>Update</code> activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>cc</code> field is how visibility is controlled on Mastodon (I think) but I haven't looked into it enough so Bugle only has the ability to send public posts.</p>
<p>To notify followers of a new post, send a <code>POST</code> request to the <em>global</em> of the followers instance. For the sake of simplicity I'm taking the users domain and appending <code>/inbox</code> to it. This won't work in a few edge-cases (like the MacStories example above) so I need to update Bugle to fetch the users endpoints using webfinger either when they follow an account, or each time I need to send to them.</p>
<p>If we assume I have one follower (@robb@example.com) and I make a post that mentioned another account (@dave@example.com) I need to make two requests to notify them both. A follower notification goes to the user inbox:</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$follower</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'https://example.com/@robb'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token variable">$inbox</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'https://example.com/@robb/inbox'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token variable">$headers</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">''</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// generate header signture as we did above for `Accept`  </span><br /><span class="token variable">$response</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name static-context">Http</span><span class="token operator">::</span><span class="token function">withHeaders</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$headers</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br />	<span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token function">withBody</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">json_encode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$message</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'application/json'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br />	<span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token function">post</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$inbox</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /></code></pre>
<p>And an @mention goes to the global inbox. For mentions, you need to include the <code>tag</code> array in the post data (see above).</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$mention</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'https://example.com/@dave'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token variable">$inbox</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'https://example.com/inbox'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token variable">$headers</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">''</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// generate header signture as we did above for `Accept`  </span><br /><span class="token variable">$response</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name static-context">Http</span><span class="token operator">::</span><span class="token function">withHeaders</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$headers</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br />	<span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token function">withBody</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">json_encode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$message</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'application/json'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br />	<span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token function">post</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$inbox</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<h3>Replying to a post</h3>
<p>If you look at the post data above you may have noticed a null value of <code>inReplyTo</code>. This is the part that needs to be filled in to reply to a specific post. Say I was replying to <a href="https://social.lol/@robb/109863669770547458">this <em>excellent</em> post</a> by a handsome internet person I need to include the URL as the value for <code>inReplyTo</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token string double-quoted-string">"inReplyTo"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">'https://social.lol/@robb/109863669770547458'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span></code></pre>
<p>Any posts with that set will show up as replies to the original post.</p>
<h3>A note on attachments</h3>
<p>nb: I've only tested images because it's unlikely I'll need video any time soon.</p>
<p>Attachments are included as an array in the post JSON with their mime type, url, alt text, width/height, and something I hadn't heard of before: a <a href="https://blurha.sh/">blurhash</a>.</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><br /><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />	<span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Document"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"mediaType"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"imag/jpeg"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"url"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"http://placekitten.com/200/300"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"name"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"A kitten"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"blurhash"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"L46[2Hofofof00j[offQ~qofofof"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"width"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">200</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />	<span class="token property">"height"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">300</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>A blurhash is &quot;<em>a compact representation of a placeholder for an image.</em>&quot;. So when you see blurry images loading on Mastodon, these are blurhashes. To make one you need a library for your chosen language which in my case was PHP and I used <a href="https://github.com/bepsvpt/blurhash"><code>bepsvpt/blurhash</code></a>:</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token variable">$hash</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token variable">$this</span><span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token property">blurhash</span><span class="token operator">-></span><span class="token function">encode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token variable">$attachment</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token comment">// L46[2Hofofof00j[offQ~qofofof</span></code></pre>
<p>And there you go. Everything I (think) I understand about ActivityPub. All of the code for Bugle is <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/bugle">on GitHub</a> for your perusal.</p>

<title>The Biology of the Hey Bear Fruits Makes No Sense</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/biology-of-hey-bear-fruits/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/biology-of-hey-bear-fruits/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey Bear is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtf9cFBJkHVAf2qMqF01xYg">a YouTube channel</a> with videos of dancing fruits, vegetables, and other nonsense designed to <s>make kids stfu</s> entertain young children. It works. <a href="https://rknight.me/micro/tags/babyknight/">Baby Knight</a> loves it.</p>
<p>Last night my partner asked if I was okay because I looked distant and downtrodden. I wasn't sad or tired, I was pondering the biology of the fruits that dance in these videos.</p>
<p><img alt="Hey Bear Fruits" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/hey-bear-fruit-banner.jpg" /></p>
<p>The pineapple, Baby Knight's favourite, is a classic fruit-with-a-face; eyes and a mouth on the outside rind of the pineapple. Same with the strawberry, blueberry, and a bunch of others. Pretty standard fare for a children's cartoon, they seem to love it. Beyond those it gets a bit weird.</p>
<p>A single orange, in the Hey Bear cinematic universe, is actually two creatures. The face is on the fleshy inside of each half but how did they get like that? Does a bigger fruit, or a human perhaps, have to cut them in half so they can see and talk and do whatever a living orange half does? What happens if said cutter slices off-centre, does one of them die while the other stays alive but has a part of their sibling's face on theirs, forever haunted by the memory.</p>
<p>The banana's face is <em>inside</em> the peel, able to see only when it's pulled back. Is there a ceremony for this with family and friends gathered round as the local face-revealer performs the act? Perhaps cards are sent to the parents, adorned with &quot;congrats on your baby's face&quot; and &quot;Let's face it, today is a good day&quot; on the front. They don't seem to have the ability to hear or make sound so the face is probably pretty important. Maybe the movie Face-Off is unsettling in their world, or that sewed-up-mouth scene from the Matrix.</p>
<p>And finally the millennial favourite, the avocado. The one we see on screen has the stone in tact but we never other half, the sibling. Is the stoneless sibling an outcast in Hey Bear world or are they lauded for surviving without a fairly important part of an avocado? We might never know.</p>

<title>Asset Lifespan Spreadsheet</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/asset-lifespan-spreadsheet/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/asset-lifespan-spreadsheet/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/020">episode 20 of Hemispheric Views</a> Andrew talks about his asset lifespan spreadsheet which shows the cost of an item, the date purchased, and the cost per week for said item.</p>
<p>I figured I'd have a crack at making my own and after some wrangling with formula in Numbers I was able to get something up and running. The key part was using the <code>DATEDIF</code> function to get how many days it has been since purchase:</p>
<pre><code>=(cost_of_item / DATEDIF(date_purchased, todays_date, diff_type))

=(B3 / DATEDIF(B2, TODAY, &quot;D&quot;) / 7) // for cost per week
=(B3 / DATEDIF(B2, TODAY, &quot;M&quot;)) // for cost per month
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives me an output like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>C</th>
<th>D</th>
<th>E</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Product</strong></td>
<td><strong>Purchase Date</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cost Per Week</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cost Per Month</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ATH-M50X</td>
<td>2015-12-13</td>
<td>£85.60</td>
<td>£0.22</td>
<td>£0.96</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I don't know what I'm going to do with this information beyond obsess over it but I do know I'm getting my money's worth with those Audio-Technica headphones.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the weekend I spent some time splitting the audio from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NjTWvl8x-U">the Brian Butterfield Diet sketch</a> and then subsequently the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyk6sXHY9Vg">Christmas version</a>. Both of these sketches are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peter_Serafinowicz_Show">The Peter Serafinowicz Show</a> from 2007.</p>
<p>I split the audio using <a href="https://www.felttip.com/ss/">Sound Studio</a> which has a handy &quot;split by markers&quot; feature then used <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy data files</a> to output those files including some titles from a JSON files of all the audio. As much as I'd like to sit and sketch some terrible icons for each food item I went with <a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a> to save some time.</p>

<title>One Year of Pizza Making</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/one-year-of-pizza-making/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/one-year-of-pizza-making/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In November 2021 I bought an <a href="https://uk.ooni.com/products/ooni-fyra">Ooni Frya 12</a> (thanks Black Friday discounts!) and since then I've used it somewhere between 10 and 15 times. Each time I've managed to make <em>something</em> about the pizza better; the sauce, the dough, the topping ratio. Herein lies my notes about making better pizzas.</p>
<p>For all my pizzas, I've used the <a href="https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/classic-pizza-dough">Ooni classic dough recipe</a> and I'm always aiming for a (sort of) Neapolitan style pizza.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>When I bought the oven I also picked up two peels: a <a href="https://uk.ooni.com/collections/accessories/products/ooni-wooden-pizza-peel">wooden one</a> and a <a href="https://uk.ooni.com/collections/accessories/products/ooni-pizza-peel">metal one</a>. I tend to only use the metal one so the wooden one has just become a standard chopping board. Ooni's accessories are far more expensive than other brands so I picked up a much cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08BFJ3QX5">dough scraper</a> on Amazon and I plan to get a <a href="https://uk.ooni.com/collections/accessories/products/ooni-pizza-turning-peel">turning peel</a> at some point but I won't be paying Ooni's price.</p>
<h3>Dough</h3>
<p><img alt="My first attempt" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pizza-first.jpg" /></p>
<p>My first batch was reasonably tasty but completely misshapen and definitely not thin enough. I figured using a rolling pin would be fine for rolling out the dough but that doesn't really get it thin enough and also removes a lot of the gas that makes a nice fluffy but crunchy crust. Rolling also made the dough stick to the peel and was really difficult to slide it off into the oven, even with a lot of flour underneath.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Entzcl8q7H4">This video from Ooni</a> helped a lot with working out the stretching technique. I'd also recommend any of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_f8scwrXT8tfSJpDPfGozK2QKj-mEmCA">Brian Lagerstrom's pizza videos</a> to see how he strengthens the dough before proofing.</p>
<p>I used bread flour I had lying around for the first attempt which I've since found out is not ideal. 00 flour, which is a much finer flour, is far better. I switched to <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/all-flour/sainsburys-grade-pasta-flour--taste-the-difference-1kg">Sainsbury's 00 flour</a> and then recently to <a href="https://www.rattonpantry.co.uk/products/caputo%C2%AE-blue-pizzeria-00-italian-pizza-flour">Caputo Pizzeria 00</a>. Each time the dough has gotten tastier and much easier to stretch and shape. One other change I've made is better yeast. I previously used Tesco dried yeast but I found this wasn't raising the dough as much as I liked, so I switched to <a href="https://www.rattonpantry.co.uk/products/caputo-yeast-100g">Caputo yeast</a> which has much better results.</p>
<p>I mix everything by hand (if someone wants to buy me a stand mixer I won't say no) in a metal mixing bowl, and use that for the first 2 hour proofing, then transfer the individual balls of dough into <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D7MNHVP">these pots</a>, with a bit of oil to stop them from sticking, and leave them to proof for another 2 hours. If I'm making more than I need I freeze after the first proof and get them out 12-24 hours before I need them and defrost in the fridge.</p>
<p><img alt="Dough in a pot" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pizza-pot.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<p>I want my sauce to be as easy as possible to make and after some messing around with different recipes, this is what I've come up with for a tasty but easy-to-make sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li>400g chopped tomatoes or passata</li>
<li>100g tomato puree</li>
<li>5g garlic powder</li>
<li>5g salt</li>
<li>5g pepper</li>
<li>5g chilli flakes (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is usually enough for 6-10 pizzas.</p>
<h3>Toppings</h3>
<p>My partner is a bit fussier than I am so we've mostly stuck to chicken and ham for toppings but if I have friends round I'll grab some pepperoni or similar from the supermarket. We've used cheap ham if we have it in the fridge and even that tastes great when combined with the sauce and cheese.</p>
<p>Speaking of cheese, because of availability we've mostly used cheddar which has been fine. Recently I picked up some aged mozzarella and used a 50/50 mix of that and cheddar and it tastes fantastic. <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/galbani-cucina-mozzarella%C2%A0cheese%C2%A0400g">Galbani Cucina Mozzarella</a> is the only aged mozzarella I've been able to find that is available in UK supermarkets.</p>
<p>Finally some other ingredients I've been enjoying:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jdshothoney.com">JDs Hot Honey</a> which I pop on right as the pizza comes out the over adds a nice bit of sweet flavour.</li>
<li>Candied Jalapenos. I've been using <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Haynes-Gourmet-Candied-Jalapenos-%C2%AE/dp/B07JDSP47S/">these ones from Haynes</a> but I have some fresh jalapenos on the way to attempt to make my own.</li>
<li>A liberal sprinkle of parmesan (or whatever hard italian cheese I can get my hands on).</li>
</ul>

<title>No More Ratings</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/no-more-ratings/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/no-more-ratings/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I used to use <a href="http://plotapp.io/">Plot</a> (RIP) to track movies that had a thumbs up or down system. When I switched to my own CMS for this I did the same thing. Then when I switched to Letterboxd I translated what was essentially a 1-3 rating system to the five-star system (even though it's actually out of ten not five) Letterboxd uses. From <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/">my Letterboxd profile</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>★☆☆☆☆ : Never again</p>
<p>★★★☆☆ : Fine</p>
<p>★★★★★ : Good movie, would watch again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with this system is I mostly don't watch bad movies. Or a better way to put it is I kinda like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_&amp;_Furious">bad movies</a>. Despite knowing intellectually that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption">Shawshank Redemption</a> is a &quot;better&quot; movie than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Has_Fallen">Olympus Has Fallen</a> they're both rated 5 stars in my system. I could change my system to use the full spectrum of the five stars but I just don't have the energy or the inclination to do it. How do I decide what gets 4.5 stars and what gets a 5? Is there really a discernible difference between those two ratings? Also, who gives a shit what number I've ordained upon a movie?</p>
<p>So fuck it. No more ratings.</p>

<p><a href="https://musicthread.app/">MusicThread</a> is &quot;<em>a website to create and share lists of music</em>&quot; by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@edwellbrook">Ed Wellbrook</a>. I recently started using it to save <a href="https://musicthread.app/thread/2L6IuBPKCCo7fsA8SFyXZLirH5W">new tracks I've found</a> and <a href="https://musicthread.app/thread/2L6LZz60026Onq3waGuwt7WdJ5x">new albums</a>, which are then cross-posted to <a href="https://social.lol/@robb">my Mastodon account</a> with <a href="https://echo.rknight.me">Echo</a>.</p>
<p>The iOS app, currently in beta, has a share sheet extension for adding to a thread, but for MacOS I needed to make something in Shortcuts. The shortcut I've made (after a lot of ranting about how bad shortcuts is) can either ask for a music link to add, or be used directly from Apple Music under the share menu. It then asks which thread to add the link to.</p>

<title>Notes on Migrating a Wordpress Site to Eleventy</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/note-on-migrating-wordpress-site-eleventy/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/note-on-migrating-wordpress-site-eleventy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently helped my friend Tim move <a href="https://nahumck.me/">his site</a> from a Wordpress install to a much simpler Eleventy setup. The biggest hurdle was transforming the Wordpress exported data into Markdown files. Thankfully <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown"><code>wordpress-export-to-markdown</code></a> exists. This is a command line tool that takes a wordpress export, puts all the posts in markdown files, and downloads all the images contained in the posts.</p>
<p>I did make an adjustment to this script so I could add a <code>permalink</code> attribute to each post by editing the <code>parser.js</code> file:</p>
<pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff">frontmatter: {<br /><span class="token unchanged"><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">   title: getPostTitle(post),<br /></span></span><span class="token inserted-sign inserted"><span class="token prefix inserted">+</span><span class="token line">   permalink: `${getPostSlug(post)}/index.html`,<br /></span></span><span class="token unchanged"><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">   date: getPostDate(post),<br /></span><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">   categories: getCategories(post),<br /></span><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">   tags: getTags(post)<br /></span></span>}</code></pre>
<p>The image download will take a while but once it was done I had all the posts and all the images ready to pop into an Eleventy site.</p>
<p>To match Tim's existing site it needed support for markdown footnotes and image captions. As a side note here, footnotes <em>do not</em> export well from Wordpress via the CLI tool so I had to manually fix all of them which was not fun. <a href="https://www.alpower.com/">Al Power</a> had an article for both of these features which was handy. To add footnote support I followed the steps in <a href="https://www.alpower.com/tutorials/configuring-footnotes-with-eleventy/">this article</a> which outlines how to include <code>markdown-it-footnote</code> for the markdown parsing and <a href="https://www.alpower.com/tutorials/adding-figures-with-captions-to-images-in-markdown-with-eleventy/">this article</a> to add image captions.</p>
<p>All in all it went fairly smoothly - without <code>wordpress-export-to-markdown</code> I would have had to write my own parsing script which I'm very glad I didn't have to do.</p>

<p>Some more links and tools I've found or had saved about webmentions. Read my post on <a href="https://rknight.me/adding-webmentions-to-your-site/">adding webmentions here</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/remy/wm">@remy/webmention</a></h3>
<p>Sadly the webapp side of this is <a href="https://remysharp.com/2023/01/30/on-vercel-if-some-of-my-sites-are-down">down at the moment</a> but the command line tool for <em>sending</em> webmentions is completely standalone.</p>
<p>You can pass the script a url or an RSS feed and it will scan it to find links, confirm those sites accept web mentions, and send those mentions. I ran it once on my whole feed to send any mentions and then added it to my build steps to run it on the latest post:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">npx webmention /path/to/feed.xml <span class="token parameter variable">--limit</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token parameter variable">--send</span></code></pre>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/CodeFoodPixels/eleventy-plugin-webmentions">eleventy-plugin-webmentions</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An eleventy plugin to fetch webmentions and helper methods to display them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why didn't I look for a plugin when I was doing webmentions? No idea. This is going on my list to review and see if I can streamline my code a bit.</p>

<title>Adding Webmentions to Your Site</title>

<guid>https://rknight.me/adding-webmentions-to-your-site/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Right off the bat, I read the following two articles to get a sense of how to do this so I won't go over too much of the same content but rather add some thoughts of my own about the process. I would highly recommend reading both of these.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://janmonschke.com/adding-webmentions-to-your-static-blog/">Adding webmentions to your static blog by Jan Monschke</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">Using Webmentions in Eleventy by Max Böck</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I feel like I muddled through this to get it to work. JSON and API requests I can understand. The <em>how</em> of webmentions I'm still a bit confused on but we will proceed nonetheless.</p>
<h3>What are webmentions?</h3>
<p><a href="https://webmention.net/">Webmentions are</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a simple way to notify any URL when you link to it from your site</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds simple enough. It's a link (or a comment, or reply, or like) to an article on my site. What I do know of webmentions from sites like <a href="https://localghost.dev/">Sophie's</a> and <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/">Zach's</a> is that <em>somehow</em> I can have likes, boosts, and replies from Mastodon show up on my blog posts.</p>
<h3>How though?</h3>
<p>This bit has confused me for months (I had a note about this dated November last year). Admittedly I didn't look too far into it but pretty much every article about webmentions will link to two sites: <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> and <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a>.</p>
<h4>Webmention.io and IndieLogin</h4>
<p>Webmention.io is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a hosted service created to easily receive webmentions on any web page</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Webmention.io <em>collects</em> your webmentions and exposes an API to be able to fetch these mentions but to start off you need to login which was my first hurdle: <code>We couldn't find any way to authenticate you using your website.</code>. Webmention.io uses <a href="https://indielogin.com/setup">IndieLogin</a> to log you in and apparently I hadn't added <code>rel=&quot;me&quot;</code> to any of my social links. So I added a Github link, deployed it, and was then able to login. Success.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token special-attr"><span class="token attr-name">style</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span><span class="token value css language-css"><span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none<span class="token punctuation">;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">"</span></span></span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://github.com/rknightuk<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>me<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>github.com/rknightuk<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once I logged in I was presented with tags to add to my site to accept webmentions so I promptly added those:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>link</span> <span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>webmention<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://webmention.io/rknight.me/webmention<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span><br />&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/rknight.me/xmlrpc" /</code></pre>
<p>At this point, this system will work for &quot;proper&quot; webmentions (although not added to my site yet) but what about conversations on Mastodon? That's where Bridgy comes in.</p>
<h4>Bridgy</h4>
<p>Bridgy &quot;connects your web site to social media&quot; according to the home page but moreso it converts conversations on social media to webmentions to send back to webmention.io.</p>
<p>I went ahead and signed in with my Mastodon account. After a few minutes Bridgy started showing responses to some recent Mastodon posts that had links to my blog posts. I then went back to webmention.io and there they all were. I'm not sure of the limitations of the initial scan but it only showed the last few posts I had done so I manually went and grabbed some Mastodon posts linking to my blog and put them in the &quot;Resend for post&quot; input box to grab some earlier responses.</p>
<h3>Showing Webmentions on my Site</h3>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/">Eleventy data files</a> extensively to power my <a href="https://rknight.me/automating-my-now-page/">now page</a> so I knew this would be trivial to pull into my site. Because I already have my <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api">&quot;api&quot;</a> I decided to fetch it there instead and <em>then</em> pull it into my site. For the sake of simplicity assume you don't like making your life difficult and all this would exist in Eleventy (or your site of choice).</p>
<h4>Fetching Mentions</h4>
<p>Webmention.io has <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">an API</a> to fetch mentions. There are a few different endpoints but I wasn't able to work out what all the differences were so I went with the <code>mention.jf2</code> with no other options. <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/webmentions.js">Source on GitHub</a>.</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// this API also accepts `since_id` to only get new mentions</span><br /><span class="token keyword">const</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token string">https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=</span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>webmentionskey<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token string">&amp;per-page=1000</span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token keyword">const</span> body <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><span class="token keyword">const</span> newMentions <span class="token operator">=</span> body<span class="token punctuation">.</span>children</code></pre>
<p>I've set this up to run every hour on a cron, merge new data with the existing data, and then write the data to <a href="https://api.rknight.me/api/webmentions.json">a JSON file</a>. Webmention.io <em>does</em> have an option for sending a webhook when a new mention comes in (under &quot;settings&quot;) but that might be a lot of rebuilding if a post gets popular so I'm sticking with this method for now. Then in Eleventy, I fetch this data in <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/rknight.me/blob/master/src/_data/webmentions.js"><code>src/_data/webmentions.js</code></a>.</p>
<p>To get this to render on my post pages, I lifted most of <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">Max's solution</a> with a few changes like grouping the different types of responses together. As an aside, I still don't know what a <code>mention-of</code> webmention looks like or how one happens.</p>
<p><strong>Update 07/07/2023</strong></p>
<p>I finally got some data to see what <code>mention-of</code> gives. I decided against showing these though because at least half of them didn't exist after only ~6 months.</p>

<title>Twitter Backup and Archiving Options</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/twitter-backup-and-archiving-options/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/twitter-backup-and-archiving-options/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you want to make your Twitter archive a bit more useful than the standard backup Twitter give you, there are 3 options of varying complexity I'm aware of.</p>
<h3>Option 0: Don't do anything</h3>
<p>This is by far the easiest option. Don't care about your tweets. Let them wither away into the ether. Be free from the shackles of hoarding your data.</p>
<h3>Option 1: Tiny Subversions</h3>
<p><a href="https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/">Darius Kazemi of Tiny Subversions</a> made this tool to make a self hosted, searchable archive. It's as simple as uploading the <code>.zip</code> file of your archive, give it a minute, and the new archive will be downloaded.</p>
<p><img alt="Tiny Subversions twitter archive" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/twitter-tiny-subversions.png" /></p>
<h3>Option 2: TwitVault</h3>
<p><a href="https://terhechte.github.io/twitvault/">TwitVault/</a> is a desktop App for Mac, Windows, and Linux that has the biggest feature set. Download it, login with your Twitter credentials, and let it do it's thing. This initial setup will pull everything is can from the Twitter API but that has limits: 3200 tweets and 800 mentions. Once that part of the setup is done (this can take a while), you can then pull in your full archive in the terminal.</p>
<p><img alt="TwitVault screenshot" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/twitter-twitvault.png" /></p>
<h3>Option 3: Tweetback</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback">Tweetback</a> is a tool built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and is my current choice for making my archive available. You can see mine at <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/">hellsite.rknight.me</a>. The steps to get this working are more involved than the previous options but I'm a big fan of the output. I won't go through the steps here but the <a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback/blob/main/README.md">readme</a> has detailed instructions.</p>
<p><img alt="Tweetback screenshot" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/twitter-tweetback.png" /></p>
<p>One other related part of Tweetback is <a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical">tweetback-canonical</a>. If you add your archive and username to the repository, anyone who uses Tweetback and has tweets that mention you, those tweets will link back to your archive rather than Twitter's website itself. For example, <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/1489618994000805889/">this tweet</a> where I mention Zach links to <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1489616692678434816">his archive</a>.</p>

<title>Letters: January 2023</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/letters/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/letters/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Letters is a ongoing project by <a href="https://json.blog/2022/11/28/a-new-project.html">Jason Becker</a> that I was involved in for this month. The what:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Letters will involve me corresponding with someone else on the internet over the course of a month. Each week, we will each write a letter to each other. There are no set topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The why:</p>

<p>I was thinking about how much of our history (in the West at least) comes from important figures having extensive private correspondences that were saved, catalogued, and released after their deaths. And while I’d love some private pen pals, it just got me thinking that public letters are a rich way to discuss complex issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jason posted that in November and I thought it sounded like an interesting thing to be involved in. While I don't think we hit the heights of &quot;historical figures discussing complex issues&quot;, we did have conversations about taking stock, finding time for personal projects and hobbies, and of course my Topic of the Year™ 2022: DIY. Below are the four emails from me with Jason's responses (and links to the posts on Jason's site).</p>
<p>Jason is doing this for the rest of the year which I'm looking forward to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jason,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have only interacted briefly on Micro.blog so I figured I should start by introducing myself. I’m a 30-something developer working on software for the property industry. I live with my partner, Jess, and two cats in Portsmouth on the south coast of the UK.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have spent the past 12 months decorating and redoing every room in our house - the previous owners lived here since it was built in 1971 and hadn’t done any work to it since then. This involved me learning a whole set of new skills like floor laying, wallpapering, and fitting new skirting boards (baseboards for Americans).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In July we found out my partner was pregnant with a girl and she is due in March 2023. This accelerated the timeline of getting the house finished but we are now ready for her arrival at least in terms of furniture and the nursery. Mentally ready? I’m not so sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you, Robb</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, congratulations on pending fatherhood! I’m glad we were able to slip in our month of correspondance before the pending sleep depravation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What an exciting and busy year. Even though we moved into our home 5 years ago (and it was new construction), I still feel like we need to keep decorating and redoing. Our work has been less skills-based and more “accumulating more stuff than I am comfortable owning”-based, since our new(ish) home is much larger than the 700 square feet we lived in previously. I have always found that I have ambitious of being handy in theory, but mostly fail when it comes to applying that ambition. At this stage, my partner Elsa just pays people to do things before telling me they’ve gone wrong or haven’t happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am curious, what room or project are you most proud of? I’m not quite “done”, but pretty close to having my office set up how I’d like. It was a big pandemic project since we got rid of the company office right away. Having my own space has changed my whole relationship with my home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I took a peek at the work you do and it’s fascinating. I have actually discussed this area (home management, focused on home inspections in the US followed by “asset management” and warranty support nad the like) with my work partner multiple times as an idea to pursue{^tech]. The intersection of home-renovation and your work must have been an interesting exercise. I’d be curious what you’ve learned managing your house that suprised you or changed your perspective on the work you do day to day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your participation in Letters. I’m already enjoying this project, and I hope others will as well.</p>

<h3><a href="https://json.blog/2023/01/10/letters-january-w.html">Week 2: 2023-01-10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Morning Jason,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>what room or project are you most proud of?</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The office was my top priority (my partner had different ideas) as I spend 3-4 days a week working in there and I’m very proud of how that turned out. I built the desktop and matching shelves myself from scaffold boards because finding something in the exact size I wanted turned out to be fairly difficult. This was a project that took a few weekends of lots of sanding, glueing, and staining but the final results is something I’m very proud of. Here’s an in-progress shot and the final result in situ. I also did the faux wood-panelling in our bedroom which we’re both very pleased with.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The work I do is primarily focused on property reports for tenants (inventories, fire risk assessments, etc) so there isn’t much crossover with renovating the house but I what I did learn is that planning is key. We wish we had spent a few weeks planning what we wanted to achieve before jumping into the renovation. There were definitely things that made our life a bit more difficult because we did some work when we should have waited for another job to be finished first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That sounds like an interesting job but it must be difficult to work with organisations like schools that can be slow and unwieldy to get new tech implemented. How long have you been doing that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw you posted yesterday about being ill, hope you’re feeling a bit better today?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak soon,
Robb</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Luckily, I am feeling better. Note to self, when you order a steak medium and it comes out <em>just barely rare</em> just send the damn thing back. The day of suffering that followed was not worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I've done some more work in my office since this last photo, but this is a <a href="https://json.blog/2021/07/18/current-state-of.html">not-terribly-inaccurate representation of where things are</a>. I also use the IKEA pegboard. I did not quite get as fancy on the desk itself-- which is an IKEA Karlby 98&quot; top that I had a friend cut to 80&quot; and then added some really cool metal legs from an Etsy shop. When the pandemic hit we went 100% remote, which meant tha this room got transformed into an office. I probably have 6-10 scattered blog posts about the process that landed on the setup linked above-- most of the changes by now are additional plants and things hung on the wall (plus some equipment changes).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it's pretty natural for the office to be the place you're most proud of-- it's one you get to call your own and the spot you're probably stuck spending the most time in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been thinking about doing a similar paneling look either behind our bed or possibly behind our TV. Maybe that'll be a project for when we return home. It's hard to have a big wall behind a TV-- it looks bare without anything, but most things we could put there would be distracting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working at my current company nearly 9 years. Before that, I worked at a university research center working with school districts on early warning systems, and before that, I worked for the state department of education. I think what's most challenging is that everyone is well-established. There aren't new school districts popping up building their systems and processes from scratch. The people, organizations, culture, and work processes are all fairly fixed. So we have to do things much more completely and better than most companies to even get in the door. Then we have to get a large set of folks on board so that we can deliver on our promise. We're a small team and we're supporting billions of dollars of budgeting and monitoring. There's a lot of technical/systems and cultural debt that we have to work with to succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That said, the opportunity for improvement is huge, and it's very satisfying when someone gets it and we can make their work so much easier and more effective.</p>

<h3><a href="https://json.blog/2023/01/19/letters-january-w.html">Week 3: 2023-01-19</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jason,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A late reply this week - I completely forgot about this until very late last night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your TV setup looks very similar to ours but we're lucky enough to have two wall lights behind it so the wall looks much less bare but you're right it's hard to put anything to garish there otherwise it's distracting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With 10 weeks to go, I've been thinking a lot about technology and how that will affect my duaghter. <a href="https://sallylait.com/blog/2022/08/25/digital-shadow-inheritance/">This post</a> in particular made me think about how much I'm going to share about her online once she's here. I don't think there's any right answer but it has occupied my mind the past few days.  Come to think of it, the impending birth is basically the only thing I can think about at the moment. I'm sure that we'll be fine but I can't help but worry that we won't have enough clothes or nappies, or something I haven't even thought of will go wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for non-baby things, I've been having fun messing around with the omg.lol API <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/omglolcli">building a CLI to interact with the service</a> and I'm working on add a /now page to my website (as well as the new omg.lol now pages). How has your week been this week?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak soon,
Robb</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Easily excusing the &quot;late&quot; reply (rules are once per week, doesn't have to be right at the start), with a later reply of my own. This week has been incredibly busy at work as the post-holiday break, post-three day weekend, we're really back at it and in it, started to kick in. It's been long but rewarding-- one of those weeks where you're exhausted, but I'm doing the kind of work I do well bringing the energy and attention I need to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, I've recently reorganized our team so that I have slightly smaller set of direct reports that are more &quot;coherent&quot; structurally-- I am managing directly one person who leads each function below me. It's too early to say if this is working better for the whole team, but this week made me feel confident that it works better for <em>me</em>, which is really important for avoiding burn out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the TV side, wall lights were another thing we considered-- a sconce on each side just to give it <em>something</em>. It just feels strange to have so much blank space <em>above</em> the TV as well. I need someone to, I don't know, share a Pinterest board or something with me so I can figure out what people actually do. The entire dilemma of what to do behind the TV reinforces a personal frustration of mine. It feels wrong that our &quot;living room&quot; is oriented toward a television. I would like for things to be different, but I don't think my partner or her mother would be sufficiently on board to make that change. It's more aspirational, really, to make sure that all television time is <em>appointment</em> time and not casual watching.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot imagine the stack of worry that comes with being just weeks away from being a dad. It's good to work with fun new tools right now while you can-- a good distraction before side projects get put aside for a while. My gut is that it's not worth worrying too much about online presence. I'm not a parent, and I'm not facing that decision, but my gut is that it's easy to overthink the consequences (or lack thereof). Short of straight up exploitation, which is rare, these things seem to work out ok for parents and kids regardless of the choices they make. That's not to say the choices don't matter, but it seems like there aren't wrong choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a big fan of /now pages (I really need to update mine). I really value the narrative of a Now page. For me, it's a time I get to think about what matters that gets lost in the series of smaller posts or dripped out updates. I have resisted adding any &quot;automated&quot; elements-- it'd be easy to add the book I'm currently reading, for example, or maybe something like starred articles from my RSS reader. Something to think about.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We're coming to the end of our time in Mexico. I'm thinking a lot about what makes home, well, home, and what I've learned about where I want to live and what I want my life to be like from 2+ months away. It's a different kind of taking stock than becoming a parent, but I find myself taking stock nonetheless.</p>

<h3><a href="https://json.blog/2023/01/28/hi-jason.html">Week 4: 2023-01-28</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jason,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another later-in-the-week reply for our last week of this project. To what you said about taking stock, I think a break or a big life change is an excellent time to think about these things. We found ourselves doing that when we moved into this house and once again when we knew we were having a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Onto which, the final preparations are now taking place: washing the clothes, organising the nursery, and prepping the hospital bag (a long with many pregnancy and post-pregnancy products I'd never realised even existed). I've gone past the worrying stage now for the most part and I'm focusing on things I <em>can</em> control.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mexico sounds wonderful and I hope you've been able to relax and enjoy it - spending an extended time away from home in somewhere so different sounds lovely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now to get a little bit meta about this project of yours. Having done this for four weeks now I'm struck by how difficult I've found being committed to writing <em>something</em> every week - it's certainly a good job I suggested early in the year pre-baby else I'm not sure it would have gone quite as well. Despite having ideas here and there for little projects or blog posts something about the somewhat stricter schedule I've struggled to do it &quot;on time&quot; (despite the loose rules).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have, however, really enjoyed being part of this project and I'm looking forward to reading in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak soon,
Robb</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s funny, because here at the beginning of this project, while taking stock, I’ve had two contrary reactions. First, it does take a surprising amount of discipline to sit down and write to someone. It’s certainly harder than just shooting off whatever is at the top of my mind. Second, it feels so feeble to just write a letter once a week while I see all the progression you’ve been making on several side projects, while preparing for the baby, during this same month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve been <a href="https://rknight.me/automating-my-now-page/">automating your now page</a>, <a href="https://rknightuk.github.io/mac-30-font-svg/">released a widely celebrated set of icons</a>, built a <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/omglolcli">CLI for omg.lol</a>, and a host of other small projects. Based on <a href="https://chaosweb.space">chaosweb.space</a>, I think you’d like <a href="https://mynameiser.in">mavica’s work</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s generating that itch in me again to figure out how to leave some energy at the end of the day to do the things I love on the computer after doing those things at work all day on the computer. Part of my taking stock is realizing that I have to find a way to push over that activation energy hump so that I can just work on small tools for myself all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m glad this first month felt like just writing letters to a friend about what’s happening— it feels like an easy introduction. Maybe they’ll all go this way, but maybe some folks will want to really dig into a specific topic. I’m glad that I am not responsible for writing the first letter, because I think that makes it more likely that each month will be a bit different based on who is participating.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for helping me kick off this project.

<title>Get Mastodon Account ID from Username</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/get-mastodon-account-id-from-username/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/get-mastodon-account-id-from-username/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Note: Every Mastodon has an RSS feed you can use to get statuses if you don't need the data in JSON format <code>https://example.social/@foobar.rss</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to get a user's statuses from Mastodon you can't just look these up with the username. You need, to quote the documentation, &quot;the ID of the Account in the database&quot;. To get this, we can use the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/#lookup">lookup endpoint</a> that will return what we need:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># for an account on example.social</span><br /><span class="token function">curl</span> https://example.social/api/v1/accounts/lookup?acct<span class="token operator">=</span>foobar<br /><br /><span class="token comment"># also works for remote accounts</span><br /><span class="token function">curl</span> https://example.social/api/v1/accounts/lookup?acct<span class="token operator">=</span>foobar@another.social</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the username is valid, you will receive a response like this:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token property">"id"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"1234567891011121314"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token property">"acct"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"foobar"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token property">"username"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"foobar"</span><br />    <span class="token comment">// ...</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Then you can use that ID to make a request for a users statuses:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">curl</span> https://example.instance/api/v1/accounts/1234567891011121314/statuses</code></pre>

<title>Everything Should Have an API: I'm Done with Closed Services</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/im-done-with-closed-services/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/im-done-with-closed-services/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I'm not signing up to any service that doesn't offer at minimum RSS feeds for my data. Ideally an API, even a simple one. No more apps that aren't <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/psa-do-not-use-services-that-hate-the-internet/">part of the web</a>. I'm done.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://localghost.dev/blog/everything-should-have-an-api-adventures-in-trying-to-automate-stuff/">Sophie</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why bother tracking what you're playing/reading/watching if you can't then do fun stuff with that data?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it too much to ask for an RSS feed of listen history from my podcast apps? Every single one of them collects and stores that data but (as far as I know) don't make that data available easily via RSS or an API. One of the apps must have this, please let me know.</p>
<p>There are a loads of mobile apps for tracking game collections, movies watched, habits logged, but most of of them have no way to access the data on the web, let alone programatically; god forbid I want to access stuff from a browser on my Mac instead of using my phone all the time.</p>
<p>I shouldn't need to set a reminder every week/month/year to go and request an export of <em>my</em> data just to have it backed up, posted to my blog, or whatever else I want to do with it.</p>
<p>I'm done with closed services.</p>

<title>Web Scraping with Node and Cheerio</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/web-scraping-with-node-and-cheerio/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/web-scraping-with-node-and-cheerio/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This post is a spin-off from <a href="https://rknight.me/automating-my-now-page/">Automating My Now Page</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you want to programatically get data from a site that doesn't have an API, scraping is the solution. Keep in mind scraping could be against the terms of service of some websites or illegal in some places. To scrape a website there are (at least in this tutorial) two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the web page content</li>
<li>Find the data inside the HTML you've collected</li>
</ol>
<p>For this tutorial, we'll scrape two things from <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/rknightuk">my PSN profile</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest game I'm playing</li>
<li>The link to the game</li>
</ul>
<p>We should end up with an object that looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">scrapedData <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br /> <span class="token literal-property property">title</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br /> <span class="token literal-property property">link</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/14419-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy/rknightuk"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>For this tutorial you'll need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> installed - version 17 or higher to make use of the native version of <code>fetch</code>.</p>
<p>Create a directory and navigate to it:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">mkdir</span> psn-scraper<br /><br /><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> psn-scraper<br /></code></pre>
<p>Next we will initialise the project. You can either fill in all the details or append <code>-y</code> to the command to skip all the questions:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># with questions</span><br /><span class="token function">npm</span> init<br /><br /><span class="token comment"># skip all questions</span><br /><span class="token function">npm</span> init <span class="token parameter variable">-y</span></code></pre>
<p>Next we need to install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio">Cheerio</a>. Cheerio is a subset of jQuery designed to run on the server for DOM parsing and manipulation.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> cheerio</code></pre>
<p>If then install works correctly you should have a <code>package.json</code> and <code>package.lock</code> file in your directory.  In the <code>package.json</code></p>
<p>Finally, we'll create our scraper file:</p>
<pre><code>touch index.js
</code></pre>
<h3>Fetching the HTML</h3>
<p>The first step is to fetch the HTML of the page we want to scrape which we'll do with <code>fetch</code>. In your <code>index.js</code> require <code>cheerio</code> and add a <code>run</code> function that using <code>async</code> (we'll be using <code>await</code> so this needs to be in a function).</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> cheerio <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'cheerio'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><br /><span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">run</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br /> <span class="token keyword">const</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'https://psnprofiles.com/rknightuk'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><br /> <span class="token keyword">const</span> body <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">text</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><br /> console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>body<span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span><br /><br /><span class="token function">run</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>If we call <code>node index.js</code> a large amount of HTML will be output to the terminal. At this point we could use regex to find the data we want but using regex on HTML is notoriously difficult and unreliable. Instead Cheerio will do all the heavy lifting for us.</p>
<h3>Parsing the Data</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to do is find a class name or ID on the list of games so we can correctly target it. If we inspect the first game in the list of games on my profile, we can see that the link itself which contains the title and url has a class of <code>title</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="Web inspector showing the link with class names" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/psn-profile-inspector.png" /></p>
<p>On some websites this might be enough to get what we need, but a quick check in the console with <code>document.getElementsByClassName('title').length</code> shows there are 91 elements on the profile page with that class but the games list only has 75 games in it so we need to be more specific. The list of games is inside a <code>table</code> element with an ID of <code>gamesTable</code> so we can use that in combination with the <code>title</code> class name. If you've used jQuery before the syntax will be familiar to you:</p>

<p>We now have an array of games which we can get the title and link from. Because Cheerio's API is the same as jQuery we can used <code>first</code>,  <code>attr</code>, and <code>text</code> to get the values we need:</p>

<title>Automating My Now Page</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/automating-my-now-page/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/automating-my-now-page/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This post outlines how I automated my now page(s) but I should start with what a now page <em>is</em>. From <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a &quot;now page&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had heard of now pages a long time ago and always meant to add one to my site but just never got round to it. A few weeks ago <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">omg.lol</a> launched their now page feature which made me think about this again (and I want to keep both my personal site and the omg.lol now page up to date and in sync). One problem with a page that should, in theory, be updated regularly is I will <em>definitely</em> forget to do it. Automation to the rescue! Or more specifically a veritable grab-bag of python and node scripts, web scraping, and APIs.</p>
<p>If you just want to see the pages here are the links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rknight.me/now">/now</a></li>
<li><a href="https://robb.omg.lol/now">robb.omg.lol/now</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api">source code is on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For each service I'm pulling data from I'm doing mostly the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch some data from <em>somewhere</em></li>
<li>Format that data to make is easier to work with</li>
<li>Add it to <a href="https://api.rknight.me/api/data.json"><code>data.json</code></a></li>
</ol>
<p>I then call <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/now/generate.js"><code>now/generate.js</code></a> which goes through each key in <code>data.json</code> and outputs it to two markdown files: <a href="https://api.rknight.me/api/now-omg.txt"><code>now-omg.txt</code></a> (for omg.lol) and <a href="https://api.rknight.me/api/now-web.txt"><code>now-web.txt</code></a> (for my website). The web version skips the omg.lol-specific syntax and intro section.</p>
<p>For omg.lol, I wanted to append icons to each line so they display as the bullet on my omg.lol now page. I grabbed icons for each section from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> and apply them as I loop through item in a section:</p>

<h3>Getting the data</h3>
<h4>Music</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/lastfm.js"><code>services/lastfm.js</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a nice easy one: show the albums, tracks, and artists I've been listening to the past seven days. <a href="https://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm</a> have a decent, if slightly oddly designed, API to get this data.</p>
<p>Not so easy is that Last.fm no longer return artist or track images. To get around this I do a lookup with the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API">MusicBrainz</a> which gives me a link to <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mn0000289599">AllMusic</a> which I then scrape and grab the main image with <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/">Cheerio</a>.</p>
<p>I also use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-to-image"><code>text-to-image</code></a> to generate images for artists and albums where I'm unable to get one either from Last.fm or AllMusic:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">await</span> textToImage<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">generate</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>album<span class="token punctuation">.</span>name<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token string"> by </span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>album<span class="token punctuation">.</span>artist<span class="token punctuation">.</span>name<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">maxWidth</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">200</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">customHeight</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">200</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">textColor</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'white'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">textAlign</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'center'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">margin</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">bgColor</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'black'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />    <span class="token literal-property property">verticalAlign</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'center'</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p><img alt="Example of top album output" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/now-albums.png" /></p>
<h4>Github, Books, and Statuses</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/github.js"><code>services/github.js</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/books.js"><code>services/books.js</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/statuses.js"><code>services/statuses.js</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are all straight-forward API calls with a slightly manually process of tagging projects on GitHub with <code>now</code> - I don't want every recent project showing up and GitHub doesn't have an API for star lists yet.</p>
<h4>Games</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/psn.js"><code>services/psn.js</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Like the missing artist images, this involved scraping a page because PSN doesn't have an API. I scrape my <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/rknightuk">PSN Profiles</a> and use Cheerio to grab the latest games I've got trophies for. It's not a perfect system, but it's likely the current game I'm playing will be the top of that list.</p>
<h4>Overcast</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/overcast"><code>services/overcast.js</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This export isn't a secret, nor are the scripts to download it but don't hammer this endpoint. I'm downloading once a week. I have emailed Marco to ask if he'd implement an RSS feed of listen history so this isn't required.</strong></p>
<p>This one was trickier but doable. Overcast offers an <a href="https://overcast.fm/account">&quot;All Data&quot; export</a> but you need to be logged in to access it. And it's in OPML format. So this is a two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/tree/main/services/overcast/fetcher">this python script</a> to login and download the export</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/tree/main/services/overcast/parser">this node script</a> to convert the OPML to JSON and then to <a href="https://api.rknight.me/api/podcasts.json">a valid JSON feed</a></li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I noticed is that <a href="https://www.relay.fm/membership">Relay's member show</a> feeds show the episode and show URL as <code>relay.fm/membership</code> so I had to handle this myself. Example here with <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Connected Pro</a>:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> isConnectedPro <span class="token operator">=</span> podcast<span class="token punctuation">.</span>title <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">'Connected Pro'</span><br /><br /><span class="token keyword">let</span> episodeUrl <span class="token operator">=</span> episode<span class="token punctuation">.</span>url<br /><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>isConnectedPro<span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token keyword">const</span> episodeNumber <span class="token operator">=</span> episode<span class="token punctuation">.</span>title<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">split</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">':'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><br />    episodeUrl <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token string">https://relay.fm/connected/</span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>episodeNumber<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>From this data, I take the last 30 episodes, group them by show, and rank them by episode count which then becomes the podcasts section of the now page.</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/services/other"><code>services/other.js</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the &quot;about&quot; and &quot;tv&quot; sections, I wanted to be able to update these from anywhere so I opted to dump some yaml in an <a href="https://robb.paste.lol/now.yaml">omg.lol pastebin</a> and fetch it from there.</p>
<h3>Syncing the changes</h3>
<p>Each data source doesn't need to be updated every hour or day, so I split them out into a <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/makefile"><code>makefile</code></a> for jobs to run on a Monday (music, books, games), a Friday (Overcast), and daily (about, tv, github projects). (I could have done these all as separate cron jobs but it was easier to split them in a make file and just have three scheduled jobs instead).</p>
<p>Each time a job runs, it updates the <code>data.json</code> file so I can run <code>generate.js</code> and <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/blob/main/now/update.js"><code>update.js</code></a> at any time throughout the week to update my now pages. The <code>update</code> script posts the contents of <code>web-omg.txt</code> to the <a href="https://api.omg.lol/">omg.lol API</a> and sends a webhook to <a href="https://forge.laravel.com">Forge</a> to deploy my main site.</p>
<p>All of the code for this is <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/api/">on GitHub</a> if you want to do something similar.</p>

<p>When I started my industrial placement at Radweb nearly 10 years ago (👴), <a href="https://github.com/danharper">Dan Harper</a> sent me his <a href="https://github.com/danharper/dotfiles">bash aliases</a> which included a lot of handy Git ones including this one that uses <a href="https://github.com/mptre/pick"><code>pick</code></a> to list git branches. I can either do <code>gco</code>, search, and enter to checkout to that branch, or do <code>gco branchName</code> to checkout immediately to a branch:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function-name function">gco</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span> <span class="token variable">$#</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-eq</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token keyword">then</span><br />        <span class="token function">git</span> checkout <span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span><span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token operator">|</span> pick<span class="token variable">)</span></span><br />    <span class="token keyword">else</span><br />        <span class="token function">git</span> checkout <span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$@</span>"</span><br />    <span class="token keyword">fi</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>I do use <a href="https://github.com/martvdmoosdijk/zsh-marks"><code>zsh-marks</code></a> already to jump to folders I've expicitly marked (as well as jumping to the root of projects with <code>jump sites</code>) but last night while doing the <code>cd ..; cd project-name</code> dance between different projects I <em>hadn't</em> marked I realised I could apply this same thing to my personal sites folder which as the time of this writing has 97 folders. To do this, I needed to list out the directories with <code>ls</code> and the <code>-1</code> option which tells <code>ls</code> to show one per line and just the folder name:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function-name function">site</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span> <span class="token variable">$#</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-eq</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token keyword">then</span><br />        <span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> ~/path/to/sites/<span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span><span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-1</span> <span class="token string">"~/path/to/sites"</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> pick<span class="token variable">)</span></span><br />    <span class="token keyword">else</span><br />        <span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> ~/path/to/sites/<span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$@</span>"</span><br />    <span class="token keyword">fi</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>So now to jump directly to the folder for this website instead of doing <code>j sites</code> then <code>cd personal/rknight.me</code> I can simply do <code>site rknight.me</code>. You can see all my aliases in <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/dotfiles">my dotfiles on GitHub</a>.</p>

<title>Bye Almanac, Hello Lantern</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/bye-almanac-hello-lantern/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/bye-almanac-hello-lantern/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am a hoarder of data. I have exports from dead Tumblr sites, Twitter accounts,  Pinboard, Instapaper, and probably more I'm not thinking of. I also like to be able to check when I did something, watched something, or just tweeted something funny (it happened <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/656762307494682624/">at least once</a>).</p>
<h3>Bye Almanac</h3>
<p>In February 2015 <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/569782414899355648/">I started using</a> <a href="http://plotapp.io/">Plot</a> (RIP) for tracking movies I've watched. This was before I'd heard of <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> and before the proliferation of the many TV and movie tracking apps on iOS. Within a few months I decided I wanted the same for TV shows I'd watched and games I played so I started work on the first version of Almanac. I built this with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> which worked well but was missing any kind of search and I couldn't post from my phone (I suppose I could but I <em>hate</em> doing things on my phone). Sadly I don't have a copy of this version of site but I do have this rather natty screenshot of it:</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of version one of Almanac" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/almanac-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018 and I did the <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/almanac/commit/2595bc622f75ef5ddc9a85cd745dd216b69fbddc">first commit</a> on version two. This version was built on Laravel for the backend and a React front end. It used the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TMDB API</a> for movies and TV, and the <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/api/">GiantBomb API</a> for games. I built a <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/almanac/blob/master/app/LetterboxdFetcher.php">Letterboxd importer</a> to poll my profile RSS feed to grab new reviews and store them in Almanac, kept track of how many times I'd watched a movie, and more recently used it to cross-post Letterboxd reviews to Micro.blog. This has now been replaced with <a href="https://echo.rknight.me">Echo</a>.</p>
<p>When I started using Micro.blog early last year I realised it made no sense to have all these different places I was posting things so I spent some time exporting the ~1200 posts from Almanac and importing them into Micro.blog. Since then I've been posting directly to Micro.blog, with the exception of movies which are still fed in from Letterboxd. For the sake of posterity, here's a couple of screenshots of Almanac as it exists now:</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the front end of Almanac" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/almanac-screenshot-1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the backend of Almanac" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/almanac-screenshot-4.png" /></p>
<h3>Hello Lantern</h3>
<p>Like version one of Almanac, I've missed being able to quickly search for a movie or TV show to grab the year or link when posting to Micro.blog. Which is why I built <a href="https://lantern.rknight.me">Lantern</a>. Lantern uses the same APIs as Almanac (and even shares some of the same design for search). It grabs the year (release or first aired) as well as the poster and converts it to Markdown for posting to Micro.blog. Of course it also pops the <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/emoji-in-discover/34">discover emoji</a> in there too.</p>
<p><img alt="Lantern screenshot" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/lantern-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>I started with a version that logged you in and would post automatically but realised that made it more complicated that it needs to be. I switched it over to use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/">Netlify functions</a> for the API and a mess of vanilla JS for the front end. Micro.blog has the posting UI so I just needed to generated the main content. Micro.blog already has book support so I don't think I'll be adding too many features to Lantern but please let me know if you find any bugs or you have any litte requests.</p>

<title>Import RSS to Micro.blog and Mastodon with Echo</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/echo-rss-to-microblog/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/echo-rss-to-microblog/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Echo running in a terminal" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/echo-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Update 13/01/23</strong>: Echo now supports Mastodon and webhooks as well as Micro.blog. <a href="https://echo.rknight.me">Check out the website for more details</a>.</p>
<p>After a conversation with <a href="https://zoeaubert.me">Zoe</a> about <a href="https://status.lol">status.lol</a>, as well as <a href="https://micro.blog/muhh/15830286">this reply from Markus</a>, I decided to write <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/echo">Echo</a> last night (do I know how to party on my birthday or what?). From the readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Echo is a node script to post new items from an RSS feed to Micro.blog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micro.blog already supports importing RSS feeds and handles it very well but <s>I'm a control freak</s> I wanted a bit more control over the formatting as well as assigning categories on import.</p>
<p>Echo takes a config of RSS feeds as well as some formatting functions for items and posts them to Micro.blog. I run mine every 15 minutes but you could set it up to run whenever you want. The only requirements are <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> and a server to run it on (or you could run it on your computer and manually run it as and when).</p>

<title>Blogs and Wikis and Links</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/blogs-and-wikis-and-links/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/blogs-and-wikis-and-links/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I've been thinking about how better to handle all the different places I'm posting too including this site,  <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk">Micro.blog</a>, and <a href="https://intersect.rknight.me/">my wiki</a>.  To quote <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2023/01/07/starting-to-think.html">myself</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting to think some things I’ve put into my wiki might be better served as a blog post that I just update as and when I find things. The discoverability of pages is kinda crappy for anyone who isn’t me (because I know to go there to look for things)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, <a href="https://intersect.rknight.me/buying-a-house/">this page about buying a house</a>. Why isn't this a blog post? It <em>looks</em> just like one, it's unlikely I'm going to buy another house so this is likely to be all I ever write about it. <a href="https://intersect.rknight.me/cli/git/">This git page</a>. There's no reason I couldn't have this as a blog post and just update it as I find other things. People are more likely to find it as a blog post than a page on my wiki.</p>
<p>Then there's the opposite: <a href="https://intersect.rknight.me/hardware/raspberry-pi/pisight/">this PiSight page</a> is 100% links. I wonder if a link system with tags would be better than posting to a specific page each time I find a new link. Or I could add the links to <a href="https://rknight.me/building-a-pisight/">the PiSight blog post I wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The Intersect was fun to build but it's <em>complicated</em>. The build process takes a while, making any structural changes is a pain. Something simpler might be better. I should reduce it to the bare minimum of things that I need from it.</p>
<p>Should I incorporate the wiki into my personal site instead of having it on a different domain perhaps? Should I just do more blog posts when I find interesting things and not worry if it's &quot;worth it&quot; to post? Who knows.</p>

<title>Using PageFind with Eleventy for Search</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the past, I have implemented my own search for static sites and while it's good <em>enough</em>, it's not great. Recently <a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback">Tweetback</a>, a self-hosted Twitter archive, added search using <a href="https://pagefind.app">PageFind</a> so I dug into the code to see how it's done. PageFind is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your users’ bandwidth as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn't even heard of PageFind until a few weeks ago so most of what I've learnt here came from the PageFind docs and the <a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback/pull/27">pull request</a> that added search to Tweetback so a big thanks to <a href="https://alistairshepherd.uk">Alistair</a> for writing the PR.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Note: I had to change some directories for <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/eleventy-pagefind-demo/">the demo</a> to get this to work on GitHub pages but everything works exactly the same as below.</p>
<p>To get started, install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pagefind">the package</a> to your Eleventy project. PageFind has <a href="https://pagefind.app/docs/installation/">more detailed installation instructions on their website here</a>.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> --save-dev pagefind</code></pre>
<h3>Build the index</h3>
<p>PageFind works by scanning a bunch of HTML files and looking for <a href="https://pagefind.app/docs/indexing/">one of the <code>data-pagefind</code> attributes</a>.  We'll add the <code>data-pagefind-body</code> attribute to the article element that wraps the posts to tell it to index the post content:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>article</span> <span class="token attr-name">data-pagefind-body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><br />    {{ content | safe }}<br /><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>article</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre>
<p>We want to run the PageFind CLI <em>after</em> the site has been built so we use the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/events/#eleventy.after"><code>after</code> Eleventy event</a> and run the command with <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processexecsynccommand-options"><code>execSync</code></a> on all HTML files in the built site:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> execSync <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'child_process'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><br />module<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function-variable function">exports</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">eleventyConfig</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />  eleventyConfig<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">on</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'eleventy.after'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token function">execSync</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token string">npx pagefind --source _site --glob \"**/*.html\"</span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token literal-property property">encoding</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'utf-8'</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br />  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you haven’t already, you must install <code>child_process</code>: <code>npm i child_process</code>. Once you have done that, add the line <code>const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;</code> somewhere before the function, in your <code>.eleventy.js</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 24/07/23</strong>: If you have a lot (read: ~3000) of pages like I do then you might find the build crashes trying to build the index. If that's the case, do the pagefind command <em>after</em> your Eleventy site build script has finished instead of in the <code>after</code> event.</p>
<p>Note the <code>_site</code> source option - if your site is built to a different directory then change this. This outputs a <code>_pagefind</code> directory to the build folder.</p>
<h3>Add a Search Box</h3>
<p>PageFind has <a href="https://pagefind.app/docs/api/">an API</a> if you want to make your own search interface but for this we'll use the built-in UI. Add the following to wherever you want the search box to appear, in the case of this demo it's going on the home page.</p>
<p>Add the PageFind stylesheet either in the head or above your search box element. The additional styles are optional and only needed if you need a dark theme/mode.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>link</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>/_pagefind/pagefind-ui.css<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>stylesheet<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><br /><br /><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>style</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token style"><span class="token language-css"><br />  <span class="token atrule"><span class="token rule">@media</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token property">prefers-color-scheme</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> dark<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />    <span class="token selector">:root</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br />      <span class="token property">--pagefind-ui-primary</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #eeeeee<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />      <span class="token property">--pagefind-ui-text</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #eeeeee<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />      <span class="token property">--pagefind-ui-background</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #152028<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />      <span class="token property">--pagefind-ui-border</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #152028<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />      <span class="token property">--pagefind-ui-tag</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #152028<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br />    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><br />  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><br /></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre>
<p>PageFind requires an element with an ID which can then be passed to the script.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>search<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>search<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><br /><br /><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>/_pagefind/pagefind-ui.js<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token special-attr"><span class="token attr-name">onload</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span><span class="token value javascript language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">PagefindUI</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token literal-property property">element</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'#search'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token literal-property property">showImages</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">"</span></span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token script"></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Run your Eleventy serve script and if everything has worked, you should have a functioning search that searches all your posts:</p>
<p><img alt="Search box with McFly as the search term and three results" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pagefind-eleventy.png" />
The code for this is <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/eleventy-pagefind-demo">on GitHub</a> and there is a <a href="https://rknightuk.github.io/eleventy-pagefind-demo">live demo here</a>.</p>

<title>Just 2022 Things</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/just-2022-things/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/just-2022-things/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://localghost.dev/blog/2022-the-year-in-lists/">Sophie's post</a> I decided to do a little roundup of things I've done the year.</p>
<h3>House Project</h3>
<p>We purchased our house in November 2021 and it hadn't been decorated since 1971 so everything needed doing; most of this year has been spent getting all the rooms fixed up. In July, we found out my partner was pregnant (🎉) which is very exciting but also added an extra bit of stress to making sure the house was done by the end of this year. Things I learnt how to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/11/06/its-finally-finished.html">Fitting laminate flooring</a> - This isn't difficult per se, but it is <em>hard</em> work.</li>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/08/07/my-first-and.html">Wallpapering</a> - This is a pain in the arse, I hate it, and will never do it again. I do like the finished wall <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/27/final-floor-in.html">now it has the mirror and radiator though</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/11/24/in-better-news.html">Installing skirting boards</a> - Again, a bit of a pain but with a decent mitre saw and some <a href="https://trade.evo-stik.co.uk/products/grab-adhesives/gripfill">Gripfill</a> it doesn't take too long.</li>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/04/06/im-like-ron.html">Building a desk from scratch</a> - This was a fun woodworking project. I'm pretty happy with <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/04/22/i-heard-were.html">how it turned out.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>In February we went to Rome, visited all the normal sites, and ate so much <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/02/24/pizza.html">incredible pizza</a>. We stayed right near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome">The Pantheon</a> which was perfect for walking everywhere we needed to go.</p>
<p>In April we went to Bournemouth for a few days and saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_for_Soup">Bowling for Soup</a> on the last day.</p>
<p>Right before Christmas we went to Edinburgh to visit the Christmas market (which was a bit disappointing) but we did a tour of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Vaults">Edinburgh Vaults</a>, rubbed the nose of <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/19/edinburgh-day.html">Greyfriar's Bobby</a>, and visited some great book shops.</p>
<p>We saw a bunch of theatre shows this year as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hamiltonwestendshop.com">Hamilton</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sixthemusical.com">Six</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thebookofmormonmusical.com/london/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;campaign_id=17961066709&amp;adset_id=&amp;ad_id=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbqdBhDvARIsAGYnXBPs12fWJd3GhcOAKGkJVZVY33b3MIfGN8yz0HqLDzKh0NCaommr2GQaAgAPEALw_wcB">Book of Mormon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com">Back to the Future: The Musical</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(Lloyd_Webber_musical)">Cinderella</a> - This was an interesting one because the front 8 rows rotate with the stage so you're facing everyone else. This got cancelled right after we saw it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web</h3>
<p>I made a bunch of little plugins/webapps for <a href="https://mbtools.rknight.me">Micro.blog</a> and the <a href="https://potimages.rknight.me">Monzo Pot Image Generator</a> hit over 40k images generated. I stopped using Twitter so I'm <a href="https://rknight.me/two-social-networks-in-this-economy/">using a combination</a> of <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and Mastodon - the latter is run by <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">omg.lol</a>. omg.lol is such a fun site and has a bunch of services, including a Mastodon instance. You can get it for $5 a year until tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>I didn't play many games due to the aforementioned home project but I did manage to play through the <a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">GTA Trilogy</a> as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p>
<h4>Movies</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/films/diary/for/2022/">Letterboxd</a> I've watched 103 movies this year. Of those, 12 of them came out this year. My favourites of those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/film/thor-love-and-thunder/1/">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> - This movie is a bit divisive but I loved it.</li>
<li><a href="https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/film/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery/">Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</a> - An excellent sequel to Knives Out.</li>
<li><a href="https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/film/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/">The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</a> - This was so much fun and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E1ULv6LcOk">the main song</a> is a banger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TV</h3>
<p>I didn't watch all that much TV this year but the two stands outs were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/07/14/finished-the-first.html">Reacher</a> -  As a fan of the books, I was impressed how closely this matched up. A really great adaptation.</li>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/08/16/cant-believe-better.html">Better Call Saul</a> - This show is perfect in every way.</li>
<li><a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/09/09/for-all-mankind.html">For All Mankind</a> - No other show builds suspense like For All Mankind does</li>
</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I read zero books this year which is embarrassing, I hope to change this next year. I did start <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781728236254">Men Who Hate Women</a> and hopefully will finish it soon.</p>

<title>Building a Podcast Site with Eleventy</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/bulding-podcast-site-eleventy/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/bulding-podcast-site-eleventy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When me and John started <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com">Ruminate</a>, we didn't know much about hosting podcasts so we decided to go with <a href="https://simplecast.com">Simplecast</a> to host and manage the podcast. Seven years later, Simplecast has changed quite a bit to the point that it's hindering rather than helping me post the show. It's not a bad service, but it's overkill for posting one episode every two weeks.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/23/has-anyone-moved.html">asked</a> last week if anyone had self-hosted a podcast and a few people I trust said it should be easy enough to do so I got to work. As with most of my projects, I used <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy is a very powerful static site generator that this site is built with. <a href="https://www.marclittlemore.com/create-an-eleventy-podcast-feed/">This post</a> was very helpful in pointing me in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Importing existing posts</h2>
<p>The first step was to import the existing 156 episodes into the new site. I had a look at the RSS feed to see what metadata each episode would need. Here is an example from <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com/156/">episode 156</a>:</p>
<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">layout</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> episode<br /><span class="token key atrule">guid</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> ff7d5a18<span class="token punctuation">-</span>c87c<span class="token punctuation">-</span>4420<span class="token punctuation">-</span>a6dd<span class="token punctuation">-</span>965be716aa12<br /><span class="token key atrule">title</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"156 - For Listeners Only"</span><br /><span class="token key atrule">published</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 20:55:06 +0000"</span><br /><span class="token key atrule">permalink</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 156/index.html<br /><span class="token key atrule">file</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://ruminatepod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/156.mp3"</span><br /><span class="token key atrule">length</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">10993430</span><br /><span class="token key atrule">duration</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token datetime number">00:22:49</span><br /><span class="token key atrule">summary</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Baguettes and Obsidian."</span><br /><span class="token key atrule">episodeNumber</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">156</span></code></pre>
<p>I created a new script called <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/ruminate/blob/main/scripts/feedtomarkdown.js"><code>feedtomarkdown.js</code></a>, used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch"><code>node-fetch</code></a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2json"><code>xml2json</code></a>  to parse the feed, and then looped through each episode to get the data. For the shownotes, I needed to covert that back to markdown with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/turndown"><code>turndown</code></a>. I also learnt about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart"><code>padStart/padEnd</code></a> to pad the episode numbers from <code>21</code> to <code>021</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token string">'21'</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">padStart</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'0'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">// 021</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally I output all the file names into <code>filenames.sh</code> to download all the episodes with <code>wget</code> with consistent naming:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/bash</span><br /><span class="token function">wget</span> http://path.to/file <span class="token parameter variable">-O</span> 001.mp3<br /><span class="token function">wget</span> http://path.to/file <span class="token parameter variable">-O</span> 002.mp3<br /><span class="token comment"># and so on</span></code></pre>
<h2>Creating new episodes</h2>
<p>I'm hosting the episode files on S3 and I didn't want to have to manually get the filesize, duration, and generate a UUID for each episode so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/ruminate/blob/main/scripts/new.js"><code>new.js</code></a>. This script takes an episode number, finds the mp3 file, reads the duration, title, and summary from the mp3 and outputs a new episode (with a UUID as well). This uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mp3-duration"><code>mp3-duration</code></a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-id3"><code>node-id3</code></a> to extract that data. I can then fill in the shownotes and push the new episode.</p>
<h2>RSS feed</h2>
<p>I was able to replicate <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com/feed.xml">the RSS feed</a> from Simplecast with this new setup but for some reason Safari doesn't auto-recognise it as a feed that can be opened in Podcasts/NetNewsWire. If anyone knows what attribute triggers this, I'd love to know.</p>
<p>All of the code for this is <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/ruminate">on GitHub</a> and you can see see the <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com">new website here</a>.</p>

<title>Two Social Networks? In This Economy?</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/two-social-networks-in-this-economy/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/two-social-networks-in-this-economy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The past few months Micro.blog (M.b.) has improved its support for Mastodon and thanks to Space Karen doing what he does best, I've been following more and more people from there as they join via M.b.</p>
<p>This has led to my timeline being busy which <em>is</em> good, but the way people post on Mastodon is very different to M.b. Threads (write a damn blog post please), posts with content that warnings (which rightly in my opinion M.b doesn't support), boosts (again not supported on M.b.), as well as hashtags have made the timeline feel messy and disconnected from the rest of M.b.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a>. omg.lol is a service that has a whole bunch of features, one of which is a Mastodon instance for users, <a href="https://rknight.me/social.lol">social.lol</a>. As a side note, until the end of the year it's only $5 a year (going up to $20 in 2023) so now is a good time to <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">sign up</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that had put me off signing up on any given instance is what if it shuts down because most of them are free and although some have Patreons, I'm not sure that's a sustainable model for smaller instances in the long run. Because social.lol is linked directly to a service I'm paying for I feel confident it's not going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/16/those-of-you.html">asking on M.b</a> about how people use both I made the decision to cross-post everything to Mastodon, keeping M.b as the source of truth. This has worked pretty well the past week, although I did hit some cross-posting issues of my own doing but I should be able to iron these out as I go. I'm also boosting some posts on Mastodon and may even do a <a href="https://social.lol/@sophie/109550690932963078">bit of shitposting</a> from time to time.</p>
<p>I don't really have a conclusion here other than I'm using both things for now. I might even checkout <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> at some point.</p>
<p>If you want to follow me you can do so on <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk">Micro.blog</a> or on <a href="https://social.lol/@robb">social.lol/@robb</a>. But probably don't follow me on both lest you see every post twice.</p>

<title>Prami's Challenge</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/pramis-challenge/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/pramis-challenge/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://social.lol/@prami/109530090151262300">Prami posted a challenge on social.lol</a> to decode this string and win a lifetime subscription to <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">omg.lol</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The string below is an encoded lifetime omg.lol gift code:</p>
<p>eoad1o1fpoawctnjeiri11dmj7rir6d8ehadkt4seo6u4</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>in this format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I figured I'd have a go which ended up being a good few hours. Then I <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/17/this-challenge-from.html">kind of lost my mind a bit</a>. Then went to bed having given up (and needing to be up for a flight this morning).</p>
<p>Overnight, <a href="https://social.lol/@jmj">Joanna</a> solved it and I felt like I'd been presented with a sock, I was free. <a href="https://social.lol/@prami/109531877004198974">The solution</a> was 3 schemes: <code>z-base-32</code> then <code>rot13</code> then <code>base64</code>. I googled <em>a lot</em> last night and not once did I see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#z-base-32"><code>z-base-32</code></a> so I had no chance (although I <em>was</em> <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/z-base-32">on a website that supports it</a> but clearly didn't see it).</p>
<p>Other things I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various different cypher detectors</li>
<li>Asking <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> nicely</li>
<li><a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/">hashcat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey">Ciphey</a> - this one crashed my computer trying to run overnight</li>

<title>ChatCGT and mySQL Database Schemas</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/chatcgt-and-mysql-database-schemas/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/chatcgt-and-mysql-database-schemas/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatCGT</a> is wild. I entered &quot;<em>Describe a mysql database schema for tracking the owned books of multiple people</em>&quot; and it came back with the queries to write the tables including foreign keys:</p>
<pre class="language-sql"><code class="language-sql"><span class="token keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="token keyword">TABLE</span> people <span class="token punctuation">(</span><br />  id <span class="token keyword">INTEGER</span> <span class="token keyword">PRIMARY</span> <span class="token keyword">KEY</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  name <span class="token keyword">VARCHAR</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">255</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">NOT</span> <span class="token boolean">NULL</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="token keyword">TABLE</span> books <span class="token punctuation">(</span><br />  id <span class="token keyword">INTEGER</span> <span class="token keyword">PRIMARY</span> <span class="token keyword">KEY</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  title <span class="token keyword">VARCHAR</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">255</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">NOT</span> <span class="token boolean">NULL</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  author <span class="token keyword">VARCHAR</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">255</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">NOT</span> <span class="token boolean">NULL</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  <span class="token keyword">year</span> <span class="token keyword">INTEGER</span> <span class="token operator">NOT</span> <span class="token boolean">NULL</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br /><br /><span class="token keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="token keyword">TABLE</span> owned_books <span class="token punctuation">(</span><br />  person_id <span class="token keyword">INTEGER</span> <span class="token operator">NOT</span> <span class="token boolean">NULL</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  book_id <span class="token keyword">INTEGER</span> <span class="token operator">NOT</span> <span class="token boolean">NULL</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  <span class="token keyword">PRIMARY</span> <span class="token keyword">KEY</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>person_id<span class="token punctuation">,</span> book_id<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  <span class="token keyword">FOREIGN</span> <span class="token keyword">KEY</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>person_id<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">REFERENCES</span> people<span class="token punctuation">(</span>id<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br />  <span class="token keyword">FOREIGN</span> <span class="token keyword">KEY</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>book_id<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">REFERENCES</span> books<span class="token punctuation">(</span>id<span class="token punctuation">)</span><br /><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>I do things like this regularly so I <em>can</em> do this no problem but having a rough draft dumped in front of me within seconds is handy. It even gives examples of what queries you could run with the data, so I followed up with &quot;<em>What would the query for how many books each person owns look like?</em>&quot;</p>
<pre class="language-sql"><code class="language-sql"><span class="token keyword">SELECT</span> p<span class="token punctuation">.</span>name<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token function">COUNT</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>ob<span class="token punctuation">.</span>book_id<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">AS</span> num_books<br /><span class="token keyword">FROM</span> people p<br /><span class="token keyword">JOIN</span> owned_books ob <span class="token keyword">ON</span> p<span class="token punctuation">.</span>id <span class="token operator">=</span> ob<span class="token punctuation">.</span>person_id<br /><span class="token keyword">GROUP</span> <span class="token keyword">BY</span> p<span class="token punctuation">.</span>id</code></pre>
<p>I'm not convinced I'm getting replaced <em>yet</em> but I'm a tiny bit more worried than I was a few weeks ago.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I've published a new <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> plugin called <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/micro-blog-lite-youtube">Lite YouTube</a> which does one thing: finds YouTube links in posts and appends a <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed">lite-youtube-embed</a> to the post. Example before and after below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/lite-youtube-before.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/lite-youtube-after.png" /></p>
<p>You can see it working on <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/04/last-of-us.html">this post about The Last of Us</a> or on <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/11/22/i-just-realised.html">this post with two videos</a>.</p>
<p>Why did I do this instead of using <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/embed-youtube-video/2692/7">YouTube shortcodes</a>? Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shortcodes are great but what if I change where my site is hosted? Those links won't work any more</li>
<li>(This is the real reason) I will forget, I'm too lazy to do it, this is automatic.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can install it <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/83">from the plug-in directory</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/micro-blog-lite-youtube">view the code on GitHub</a>.</p>

<title>My Office Setup</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/office-setup/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/office-setup/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>My office setup as of April 2022. (This post originally appeared in <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/reader-setup-2">MacStories Weekly)</a>.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/office-setup-tv.jpg" /></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I posted a photo in the MacStories Discord and Federico <s>demanded</s> asked very nicely if I would write about it, so here we are. I have a lot of consoles which means I have a lot of games and controllers. I’ve never been one to sell games after I’ve finished them so I always had a collection of some sort. I worked at a second hand game shop while I was at university so my collection grew rapidly in the 11 months I was there and I have continued to pick up games here and there over the years. As of right now I have 315 games across 12 systems, a third of which are for the PlayStation 2. A lot of my all-time favourite games are for the PS2 including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 and 4</li>
<li>Jak and Daxter</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (side note: despite the launch bugs, the remaster version of this is excellent)</li>
<li>Mashed: Fully Loaded</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a big fan of single-player story-driven games so the majority of my collection are those types of games. I’m currently playing through Horizon Forbidden West which I am loving.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/office-setup-cupboard.jpg" /></p>
<p>My setup consists of a PS5, a PS3, a pink PS2 which I adore, an Xbox 360, and an Xbox One all hooked up to a HiSense 4K 43&quot; TV that I bought a few years ago. I’m not sure in 2022 if I would even be able to buy a TV with this many inputs. The modern consoles use HDMI and the PS2 and 360 use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCART">SCART cables</a> which was widely used on TVs in the UK and Europe and is somewhat better than using component input.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://gameye.app/">GameEye</a> to keep track of my the games and consoles I own. I log the games I’ve played with Almanac, a custom blogging system I made for tracking things I’ve watched and played. (Update: I now use <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk">Micro.blog</a> for this). In my attic I have a Sega Master System, Nintendo 64, and a Nintendo Wii, plus there is a Nintendo Switch in the living room.</p>
<p>Until I add shelves to my office to have at least some of my games on display, I’m using the built-in cupboard as storage for my games. I built the shelves in there myself so they are a perfect size for double-stacking games. I added an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/skadis-pegboard-combination-white-s09216595/">Ikea Skadis</a> to the inside of the door to various gaming-related things like cables, controllers, and memory cards for the older consoles.</p>
<p>I have some ideas for the office including a custom controller holder, shelves to display my games and my many collector’s edition statues (these are also in storage right now), and I’m also considering wall-mounting the TV. I also need to alphabetise the games instead of dumping them in the cupboard like they are right now.</p>

<title>My Favourite Albums of 2022</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/my-favourite-albums-of-2022/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/my-favourite-albums-of-2022/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It's been a really good year for music especially for artists I've been listening to for years.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/love-sux-deluxe/1655449416">Avril Lavinge - Love Sux</a> - This is the link to the deluxe version which contains some excellent acoustic versions of some of the tracks.</li>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/kings-of-the-new-age/1607207409">State Champs - Kings of the New Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/harder-than-it-looks/1600965603">Simple Plan - Hard Than It Looks</a> - This is as good an album as they've ever made.</li>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/holy-fvck/1628440994">Demi Levato - HOLY FVCK</a> - this was a suprise entry for me, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do.</li>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/just-woke-up/1603918127">Jaret Jay Reddick - Just Woke Up</a></li>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/super-relatable/1637732324">Beefy - Super Relatable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/a-whole-new-wurst-2/1625667455">Punk Rock Factory - A Whole New Wurst 2</a> - Their  cover of <em>Surface Pressure</em> is amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The released tracks on <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/tear-me-to-pieces/1647133854">Story of the Year's new album</a> are fantastic. I can't wait to hear the rest of them.</p>
<p>Finally I discovered <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/never-look-back-deluxe/1634447768">Never Look Back by Goldfinger</a>. Apparently it came out in 2020 and I completely missed it. There's a great version of <em>Here In Your Bedroom</em> featuring Avril on this deluxe version of the album.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edwellbrook/grabgif">Ed Wellbrook solved this with grabgif</a> like the absolute hero he is.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>
<p>Turns out in my frustrated state, some of the things I tried <em>did</em> work but I just didn't notice (or I did something like clear the clipboard by accident). After looking at Ed's solution it clicked. This solution <em>does</em> work:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">osascript <span class="token parameter variable">-e</span> 'set the clipboard to POSIX <span class="token function">file</span> <span class="token string">"/path/to/animated.gif"</span></code></pre>
<p>I will leave the rest of the article but everything below is kind of useless now.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you've come to this post to find out how to copy an animated gif to the clipboard programatically: I'm sorry. All I have is many solutions that either don't work at all, or only partially work.</p>
<p>Why was I doing this? I've had an idea for an <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> workflow for a while that would list all the gifs in my gif folder then copy it to the clipboard so I can paste in to Slack (or anywhere that supports copy/pasting animated gifs). I like to keep things as simple as possible with <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows">my Alfred workflows</a> so I figured I'd try AppleScript/JXA first.</p>
<h2>AppleScript and JXA</h2>
<p>There are loads of StackOverflow posts describing how to copy <em>images</em>, some of which even say it works with gifs. They do not. At best, some of them will copy the first frame of the gif to the clipboard, at worst they flat out don't work.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># these work but will only get the first frame</span><br /><br />osascript <span class="token parameter variable">-e</span> <span class="token string">'set the clipboard to (read (POSIX file "/path/to/animated.gif") as {«class GIFf»})'</span><br /><br />osascript <span class="token parameter variable">-e</span> <span class="token string">'set the clipboard to (read "/path/to/animated.gif" as GIF picture)'</span><br /><br /><br /><span class="token comment"># these do not work at all</span><br /><br />osascript <span class="token parameter variable">-e</span> <span class="token string">'set the clipboard to (read (POSIX file "/path/to/animated.gif")'</span><br /><br />osascript <span class="token parameter variable">-e</span> <span class="token string">'set the clipboard to POSIX file "/path/to/animated.gif"'</span></code></pre>
<h2>Command Line Tools</h2>
<p>I found a number of CLI tools that looked promising. The first of these I came across was <a href="https://gist.github.com/mwender/49609a18be41b45b2ae4"><code>impbcopy</code></a> but this only works with <code>png</code> files. Perhaps there's a way to modify this to work but I wasn't able to see how to do that. Likewise with <a href="https://github.com/moicci/pngpaste"><code>pngpaste</code></a> which claims to support gifs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having spent a good few hours on this at this point I am assuming this can't be done. If someone knows of a way to do this I would be very interested to see a solution.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://replay.music.apple.com">Apple Music Replay</a> is a vast improvement on last year. I grabbed some of the data so I have a record of it (I have no idea if you can access a previous years data or not).</p>
<p>No suprises Hamilton is top again with Lin-Manuel Miranda and Leslie Odom, Jr. taking 2 of the top artist spots. Combined, they take the real top spot.</p>
<p>I was in the top 100 listeners for Punk Rock Factory and Goldfinger.</p>
<p><strong>3695 songs</strong></p>
<p><strong>696 Artists</strong></p>
<p>Top artists:</p>

<p><strong>231 Albums</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea how it works out the play count on albums but I assume this is individual tracks so I've worked out the times I've played an album based on this. Apple doesn't give numbers for albums 6-10.</p>

<title>Importing Tweets into Micro.blog</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/importing-tweets-into-microblog/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/importing-tweets-into-microblog/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I wanted to import a bunch of tweets from my archive (mostly cat photos and a few other bits) but I didn't want to have to manually go through each tweet, copy the text and download the photos. So I wrote a script to do it for me once I had the IDs (which I got with my <a href="https://rknight.me/get-safari-tabs-shortcut/">Safari shortcut</a>).</p>
<p>One thing that had annoyed me for a while is I didn't keep a diary/note of things that happened and my thoughts during the first year of so of the pandemic but thanks to going through my archive I now <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/categories/covid/">have that</a>. On a cheerier note I have a lovely collection of animals in the <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/categories/pets/">pets category</a>. These additional categories were done manually (with the help of <a href="https://github.com/sbarex/QLMarkdown">QLMarkdown</a>) as I couldn't think of a way to automate this.</p>
<p>Once I had the IDs it was a case of getting the format correctly (for example, Micro.blog will fail an import with empty categories in the YAML). I was able to take ~450 tweets, convert them to markdown and <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/categories/imported-tweets/">import them into Micro.blog</a>. For example, this tweet:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/boristweet.png" /></p>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>---
date: 2022-10-20T13:56:19+00:00
categories: Imported Tweets
---

&quot;You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me&quot;

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ffg6jkDXkAARD4p.jpg)
</code></pre>
<p>The script isn't perfect. It doesn't do anything with hashtags or usernames, nor does it check if a tweet is a reply or a retweet. The <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/twitter-to-micro-blog">project readme.md</a> has steps for using it on your own archive.</p>

<title>The "Best" Tweets</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/the-best-tweets/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/the-best-tweets/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A few days ago <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesthomson/status/1591538731756191745">James Thomson posted</a> that you can find your tweets based on how many likes they got with the following link (switching my username for yours):</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Arknightuk%20min_faves%3A1000&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Arknightuk%20min_faves%3A1000&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live</a></p>
<p>I think it's very likely my account will be deleted at some point so I figured I'd have a little look at my best tweets and archive them here (I am using &quot;best&quot; in the loosest possible way here).</p>
<p><strong>Back to the Future Day tweet - 2015-10-21 (<a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/656762307494682624">link</a></strong>)</p>
<p>This has a typo that will haunt me forever (should be &quot;Emmett&quot; not &quot;Emmet&quot;).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you Marty McFly? I’ve got something for you”</p>
<p><em>opens letter</em></p>
<p>“Emmet Brown would like you to join his professional network on LinkedIn”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also did <s>the same tweet</s> a totally original tweet when GDPR caused everyone to send a thousand emails (<a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/999648514534764544">link</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you Marty McFly? I’ve got something for you”</p>
<p><em>opens letter</em></p>
<p>“Please confirm you want to continue to receive letters from Dr. Emmett Brown”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Alt Key - 2016-08-21 (<a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/767337245133144064">link</a>)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The alt symbol (⌥) is like a track switch. An alternate route. Alt.</p>
<p>Mind blown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dark Pattern - 2018-05-27 (<a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/1000748036367310848">link</a>)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This “no I hate myself” pattern is horrible.</p>
</blockquote>
<img alt="" height="282" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/hate_discounts.jpg" width="600" />
<p><strong>Boris × Thanos - 2022-10-20 (<a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/1583079656760410112">link</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I didn't make this image. I had the idea and then grabbed the image from <a href="https://twitter.com/mattlcapon/status/1421631601902039043">this tweet</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me&quot;</p>

<p>We moved into our house November 3rd 2021, just over a year ago. Most of the house hadn't been decorated since it was built in the '70s so everything needed redoing. With the exception of a few carpets and a bit of painting, everything is now done.</p>

<title>Follow Mastodon User on Micro.blog Shortcut</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/follow-mastodon-user-on-micro.blog-shortcut/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/follow-mastodon-user-on-micro.blog-shortcut/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> has support for following and replying to Mastodon users but getting from someone's profile on Mastodon to the follow page on Micro.blog can be a pain. To search for a user you need have it in the format of <code>cooluser@mastodon.instance</code> which isn't the same as the profile URLs. To make this easier I made a shortcut that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Takes the current Safari URL, for example <code>https://mastodon.instance/@cooluser</code></li>
<li>Gets the domain (<code>mastodon.instance</code>) and the path (<code>@cooluser</code>)</li>
<li>Swaps those round to become <code>cooluser@mastodon.instance</code></li>
<li>Opens the page on Micro.blog to be able to follow that user (<code>https://micro.blog/cooluser@mastodon.instance</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>It will also check to see if the path/username contains an <code>@</code> symbol and if it doesn't will show an alert instead. This isn't ideal but given that Mastodon can have any domain, it's much harder to detect if it's a Mastodon site or not.</p>
<p>There is a meta tag in the HTML with <code>profile:username</code> as the property name but I don't know enough about Shortcuts to do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fe47f7e4ed104f7dbb8202b49c3482c4">Download Follow Mastodon User on Micro.blog shortcut v1.1</a></p>
<h3>Previous Versions</h3>

<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c055237a4b744d9eb5b120fe017b8356">v1.0</a> - this version won't work if the user hasn't been seen before by Micro.blog</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bluetooth cutting out randomly on my Mac when using wireless headphones has been an issue for me for ages. I assumed it was because of everyones BT devices in the office but I'm here by myself this morning and it was still happening.</p>
<p>Had a google around and found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/qjgqjx/i_think_ive_found_a_fix_for_the_bluetooth/">this thread</a> on Reddit and it solved it. Settings &gt; Sharing &gt; Turn off AirPlay Reciever.</p>
<p>I wish I'd looked for a solution sooner.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/settings_airplay.png" /></p>

<title>Thoughts on Micro.blog</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/thoughts-on-micro-blog/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/thoughts-on-micro-blog/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A couple of weeks ago I signed up to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and stopped using Twitter, Instagram, and Pocket.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>Micro.blog (MB for the rest of the post) has no likes, no follower counts, no retweets, and no <s>post dunking</s> quote tweets. If I post something, I don't know who saw it or who enjoyed it but it doesn't matter; I'm posting it because I want to. Might be <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/05/12/stripe-have-opensourced.html">something interesting</a> or me <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/2022/05/13/mcr-released-a.html">being nostalgic for a time when I thought I was, but definitely wasn't, cool</a> but none of it is being posted to try and &quot;go viral&quot; or get likes.</p>
<p>The lack of follower count, or even knowing if someone follows you, means there's no guilt for unfollowing someone or wondering why someone unfollowed you. No likes means if someone really does like a post a lot, they can reply and say so. <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/a-bit-of-advice/">Alan Jacobs has an excellent post</a> about this.</p>
<p>I've looked at Twitter a few times in the past month and I was reminded just how negative it is. I'm as guilty as anyone for dunking on politicians, crypto bros, and general idiots. They probably deserve it but it is <em>exhausting</em> and it's pretty much every other tweet. I don't follow news sites or &quot;brands&quot; on Twitter, these are all just normal people but we're all (rightly) angry about <em>the things</em>. I just don't think it's good for my mental health to be that annoyed about a thousand things all the time.</p>
<h3>Instagram</h3>
<p>I hadn't posted to Instagram for a long time. I'd felt uneasy about feeding content to the beast that is Facebook for a while but I also thought perhaps I didn't have anything <em>worth</em> posting. A few days after I signed up, MB were running the <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2022/04/30/the-may-photoblogging.html">May Photoblogging challenge</a>. 30 days, 30 prompts, post a photo each day. Turns out I do have things to post and you can <a href="https://toot.rknight.me/categories/may-2022-photoblogging-challenge/">view my challenge photos here</a>. Challenge photos are collected in this <a href="http://micro.blog/discover/mbmay/grid">nice grid view</a> and it's been a great way to find all the cat people.</p>
<h3>Pocket</h3>
<p>This one is less &quot;stick it to the man&quot; and more &quot;just use one service for a bunch of things&quot;. MB has a bookmarking feature that works for exactly my needs and I <a href="https://rknight.me/save-bookmark-to-micro-blog-shortcut/">whipped together a shortcut</a> as well as making a <a href="https://micromarks.rknight.me">little web app to manage my bookmarks</a>.</p>
<h3>Other things I like about Micro.blog</h3>
<p>Editable posts. What a concept.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://micro.blog/discover">discover timeline</a> is a manually curated timeline of features posts from real people and is an excellent starting point to find users to follow. <a href="https://micro.blog/jean">Jean</a> does an excellent job of curating posts for the discover page as well as helping new people to the service. The other way to find interesting posts are the automatic timelines based on <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/emoji-in-discover/34">emoji topics</a>.</p>
<p>You can follow Mastodon users from MB which mean I can still get updates from <a href="https://duck.haus/about">the duck haus</a> or any other Mastodon instance. Mastodon users can follow MB users as well. When using a custom domain with MB you can set a Mastodon-compatible username. For example mine is <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk?remote_follow=1">robb@toot.rknight.me</a>.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/json-api/97">an API</a> which I'm sure I'll be using more in the future.</p>
<h3>Missing Pieces</h3>
<p>As much as I've complained about Twitter, there are people who I still want to subscribe to. Of course Twitter doesn't have RSS feeds any more but thankfully <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a> allows me to subscribe to specific people so I'm &quot;following&quot; a handful of Twitter accounts there instead.</p>

<title>Get Safari Tabs Shortcut</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/get-safari-tabs-shortcut/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/get-safari-tabs-shortcut/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-automation-april/">Automation April</a> MacStories ran a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners/">contest</a> where people could submit a shortcut and be in with a chance of winning an Analogue Pocket and a Stream Deck.</p>
<p>Until the announcement of the contest I had never made a shortcut but I wanted to enter just for the fun of it (and that sweet role icon <a href="http://plus.club">in the members Discord</a>). I decided to convert my existing <a href="https://rknight.me/alfred-workflows/#085F8761-9FB4-492D-B466-D7CE943DCE60"><em>Get Safari Tabs</em> Alfred workflow</a> to a shortcut.</p>
<p>The shortcut gets all currently open tabs in Safari and converts them into one of 6 formats and then copies them to the clipboard</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown list: <code>- [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me)</code></li>
<li>Markdown links: <code>[Robb Knight](https://rknight.me)</code></li>
<li>Links only: <code>https://rknight.me</code></li>
<li>Titles only <code>Robb Knight</code></li>
<li>Titles with links <code>Robb Knight https://rknight.me</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I use the workflow, and now the shortcut, fairly regularly for making <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com">shownotes for Ruminate</a> and for adding links to <a href="https://intersect.rknight.me">the Intersect</a>.</p>
<p>The shortcut is MacOS only because it uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/Introduction.html#//apple_r">JXA</a> to get the current tabs and formatting them. I'm sure this could be done with shortcut actions but I already had the existing logic from the workflow and I couldn't see any advantage in converting the logic to actions.</p>

<p>I recently signed up (again) to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> in an attempt to move away from services run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">billionare shitposters</a>. I will probably write up a full post about it soon but you can hear me talk about it on <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com/episodes/144">episode 144 of Ruminate</a> or <a href="https://toot.rknight.me">view my micro blog here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features Micro.blog offers is bookmarking of posts and links. After a <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk/12770616">conversation about using micro.blog as a read later service</a> and finding the correct API I put together a shortcut to save bookmarks. You'll need to get an access token from <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">the apps settings page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/876d4c98272c4deb9f155a656a6929ec">Download Bookmark on Micro.blog</a></p>
<p>MacOS shortcuts lacks support for using the sharesheet without a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sharebot-for-shortcuts/id1597340986?mt=12">third-party app</a> so instead you can run this shortcut whenever and it gets the current Safari page URL. The iOS version shows up in the share sheet so it can be used wherever you share links.</p>
<p><s>If there's a way to combine these so one shortcut works for both MacOS and iOS, I'd love to hear it.</s> Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/pratik/12775485">Pratik</a> for showing me how to check the device type and make this one shortcut for both platforms.</p>

<title>Building a PiSight</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/building-a-pisight/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/building-a-pisight/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="My finished PiSight" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pisight.jpg" /></p>
<p>During the pandemic Max Braun managed to squeeze a Pi Zero with camera module <a href="https://debugger.medium.com/todays-webcams-are-boring-so-i-brought-back-a-classic-291cc7c94c76">into an Apple iSight camera</a>. I came across the post a few weeks ago and decided to have a go myself.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-shortages-and-our-first-ever-price-increase/">Rapsberry Pi shortage</a> I was able to order a Pi Zero, the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module-v2?variant=19833929735">camera module</a>, the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/camera-cable-raspberry-pi-zero-edition?variant=32092803891283">Pi Zero camera cable</a>, and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISight">iSight</a>. I ordered the <a href="https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight/blob/master/PiSight.stl">3D-printed internal chassis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight/issues/16">this USB adaptor</a> from <a href="https://sgd3d.co.uk">SGD3D</a> which took about a week to arrive.</p>
<p>I followed these <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Apple_iSight_Webcam">iFixIt teardowns</a> to work out how to take the iSight apart, then looked at the <a href="https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight/issues">issues on the PiSight repo</a>, and <a href="https://muffinresearch.co.uk/building-a-pisight/">this blog post</a>, to see other people putting theirs together. The main issue I had was having to trimming off the bottom two corners of the camera module to be able to fit it inside the iSight tube. I used <a href="https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam"><code>showmewebcam</code></a> for the software, which boots incredibly quickly and makes it very easy to get going.</p>
<p>Once I'd wrangled it all together I used <a href="https://handmirror.app">Hand Mirror</a> to check everything was working (the lighting is terrible in this temporary office hence why it's looks so bad):</p>
<center><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pisight-hand-mirror.png" /></center>
<p><img alt="The chassis" src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pisight-chassis.jpg" /></p>
<p>It may not be the best webcam in the world, but it's easily as good as the one I have in my MacBook, and I can move it around wherever I want.</p>

<title>Intersect</title>

<guid>https://rknight.me/intersect/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I came across <a href="https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/">Nikita Volodoev's wiki</a> recently when looking for other things and realised this was exactly the type of things I'd been looking for to store snippets, links, and other notes about various things that don't justify a full blog post. And because I'm an idiot I ended up <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/1426307649365286921">building my own solution</a> with <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>. The result is <a href="https://intersect.rknight.me">Intersect</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from just rendering a bunch of markdown files it has a number of additional features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Table of contents and breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Syntax highlight for code blocks with copy code button</li>
<li>Full search of content and links</li>
<li>Highlight search queries on navigation to a result</li>
<li>Popular pages using the <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/IXCLSF">Fathom API</a></li>
<li>Recently updated pages by parsing the git log</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a bunch of pages where you can read about what Intersect is and how it works on Intersect itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://intersect.rknight.me">The introduction page</a> has some more details about the why</li>
<li><a href="https://intersect.rknight.me/meta">The meta page</a> sets out what the purpose of the site is</li>
<li><a href="https://intersect.rknight.me/meta/readme">The readme page</a> has installation instructions, and more technical information about how it was built</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/intersect">source code is on GitHub</a> but to paraphrase <a href="https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/11ty-base">Andy Bell</a> it's not open source so much as it is free. I doubt this will meet the requirements of anyone else, it's a good base to start with, but any features I add will be because I want them.</p>
<p>There is a companion <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/intersect">Alfred workflow</a> that also searches the content and links and can also open the page in VSCode for editing.</p>
<p>I even went full <a href="http://devsdodesign.com">#devsdodesign</a> and made a logo:</p>

<title>Calendar Events Alfred Workflow</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/calendar-events-alfred-workflow/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/calendar-events-alfred-workflow/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NB: This workflow has been deprecated and replaced with the <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/raw/main/workflows/agenda">Agenda Workflow</a></p>
<p>tl;dr: Calendar events workflow for Alfred. <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/calendar-events">Download it here</a>.</p>
<p>I released a <a href="https://rknight.me/reminders-alfred-workflow/">Reminders workflow</a> a few days ago and while working on that I realised a lot of the code would be reusable for a version to manage calendar events. So I went at it tonight while it was too hot to sleep (it's 3am).</p>
<p><img alt="Calendar Events workflow for Alfred" src="https://rknightuk.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/site/calendar-events.png" /></p>
<p>Like the reminders one, it uses an only-for-this-use-case CLI tool which you <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-calendars-helper">can view on Github here</a>.</p>
<p>One difference with this one is opening and creating events. I wanted the workflow to stand on it's own but I use Fantastical as my calender so it has two modes: one for default Calendar.app and one for Fantastical. By changing the <code>usefantastical</code> workflow variable events will be opened and created in Fantastical. This is the recommended way of using it.</p>
<p>With this workflow you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>View upcoming events for the next 5 days (all or a specific calendar)</li>
<li>Open events in Calendar.app or Fantastical</li>
<li>Set a default calendar for creating events</li>
</ul>

<title>Reminders Alfred Workflow</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/reminders-alfred-workflow/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/reminders-alfred-workflow/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NB: This workflow has been deprecated and replaced with the <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/raw/main/workflows/agenda">Agenda Workflow</a></p>
<p>tl;dr: Reminders workflow for Alfred. <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/reminders">Download it here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of workflows available for <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> to manage Reminders on the Mac and I've tried most of them; none of them do everything I want. Most of them have one of these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don't order reminders based on due date</li>
<li>You can create reminders but can't view them</li>
<li>They rely on a default list for creating with no option to choose</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to have a go at building my own this weekend (and this evening). I tried a number of approaches including Javascript for automation (JXA) which was too slow and AppleScript which opens the app to access your reminders so is also slow. I then found <a href="https://github.com/keith/reminders-cli">reminders-cli</a> which is a command line tool written in Swift.</p>
<p>This tool was as close as I was able to get in terms of accessing reminders but it didn't order them by due date, and didn't allow me to view reminders from all lists, only specific ones. I cloned the repo and starting changing some stuff to do what I wanted; I've never written Swift before, so the code is <em>bad</em>. <em>Really bad</em>. I also modified the date parsing script from <a href="https://github.com/surrealroad/alfred-reminders">alfred-reminders</a>, which uses (an admittedly older version of) <a href="https://github.com/wanasit/chrono">Chrono</a> but works for this purpose.</p>
<p>After a bit more wrangling of various things like bash, AppleScript, and Alfred's various features like script filters and workflow variables I was able to get something I'm happy with.</p>
<p><img alt="Reminders workflow for Alfred" src="https://rknightuk.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/site/reminders-for-alfred.png" /></p>
<p>With this workflow you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>View all upcoming reminders</li>
<li>View upcoming reminders from a specific list</li>
<li>Mark reminders complete</li>
<li>Set a default list for creating reminders (or create for a specific list)</li>
<li>Create new reminders with natural language (e.g. &quot;Lunch with John tomorrow 1pm&quot;)</li>

<title>Monzo Pot Image Generator</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/monzo-pot-image-generator/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/monzo-pot-image-generator/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While browsing <a href="https://community.monzo.com/t/custom-pot-images-to-use/62748/325">this thread on the Monzo forums</a> I came up with an idea to generate Monzo pot images whenever I want so I created the <a href="https://potimages.rknight.me/">Monzo Pot Image Generator</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Monzo Pot Image Generator" src="https://rknightuk.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/site/preview-image.png" /></p>
<p>First thing was to work out how to generate and download the images. This turned out to be relatively easy with a combination of <a href="https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image">dom-to-image</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js">FileSaver</a>. To generate a list of the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome icons</a> output in the search, I grabbed <a href="https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/metadata/icons.json">the JSON config</a>, did a little bit of manipulating in Sublime and used <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy's global data files</a> to use that data when building the site.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep everything as simple as possible; no crazy build scripts and as few files as possible. I used <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">Water.css</a> for the base css and the rest of the css is in a <code>style</code> tag in the <code>head</code> (is that legal?). I also learnt that there is a <code>type=&quot;color&quot;</code> input - although I might replace this at some point because it's not particularly nice on mobile Safari.</p>
<p>You can also share you pot images with a link <a href="https://potimages.rknight.me/?i=chess-queen&amp;ip=fas&amp;c=333333&amp;bg=b7edd0">like this</a>. I initially used url hashes to keep the url updated all the time, but when sharing these to Twitter they get stripped out so I switched to using query strings instead.</p>

<title>Game FAQs</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/fifa-street-ps2-game-faqs/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/fifa-street-ps2-game-faqs/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Before YouTube was the go-to place for game tutorials, <a href="https://gamefaqs.com">GameFAQs</a> was one of the only decent places online to get in-depth guides on how to complete games or get cheat codes. GameFAQs only allowed text posts on the site so people came up with interesting ways to navigate chapters and sections in what feels like a precursor to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>Every guide would have an ASCII art heading and a table of contents with some unique key so you could use CMD/CTRL+F to find the relevant section. Today I remembered my only contribution to GameFAQs was a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/924938-fifa-street/faqs/36247">Fifa Street PS2 guide</a>. I'm pretty sure a lot of it was just copied from magazines and other websites but I wanted to grab a copy of it just in case it ever removed or GameFAQs shuts down. So if that link doesn't work, I've also uploaded <a href="https://rknight.me/files/fifa-street-guide.txt">the original text file</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't used GameFAQs in a <em>long</em> time but it's nice to know all those guides are still available.</p>

<title>Changing Your Name by Deed Poll</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/changing-your-name-by-deed-poll/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/changing-your-name-by-deed-poll/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I changed my name (and my email) a couple of weeks ago and I have a few thoughts about the process. Most of this should also apply if you've changed your name because of marriage.</p>
<h3>Make a List</h3>
<p>Before you do anything else, make a list of everywhere you need to change your name, along with the process to do it (letter, email, in branch). If it's a letter or email, I used this to send to each of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please be advised that on {name change date} my name was legally changed from {old name} to {new name}.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My new name should be reflected on my {credit card|account|whatever}, account number {12345}, previously held in the name of {old name}.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have included a copy of my Deed Poll. If you have further questions, please contact me at {phone number} or {email}.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sincerely,
{New Name} (previously {Old Name})</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll also need to sign that letter with your old and new signature. Becuase signatures are proof of...something?</p>
<p>I won't list everywhere I had to change my name, but here's a good list of places to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>HMRC. You can do this online through the government gateway.</li>
<li>Passport. Again, it can be done online, but you'll need to send your deed poll and another &quot;proof&quot;. I used a bank statement in my new name.</li>
<li>Driving Licence. Requires a new application form, order online or pickup in a Post Office.</li>
<li>Bank. Depends on the bank, check their website.</li>
<li>Credit Cards.</li>
<li>Insurance (house, car, phone, etc)</li>
<li>Utilities (water, gas, electric)</li>
<li>Mortgage/Landlord</li>
<li>Electoral Register. You can do this online by registering to vote and it will ask if you've changed your name.</li>
<li>Council Tax</li>
<li>Paypal. They require additional proof including photo ID and a bank statement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make Multiple Deed Polls</h3>
<p>I used <a href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/">Free UK Deed Poll</a> to make my deed poll, printed on some certificate paper I got on Amazon. This is 100% legal and any company that charges you for a deed poll is just printing a piece of paper for you. I would suggest getting at least four or five deed polls signed (you need two witnesses); I currently have three in the mail and a final one at home which won't be leaving my sight until at least one has been returned.</p>
<h3>Do Your Passport or Driving Licence as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Despite a deed poll being a legal document, there are some places that won't accept that as proof without additional documentation, namely a photo ID of some kind. Getting either your passport or driving licence done quickly will make the process a lot easier. If you don't have either of those, you'll have to argue with them like I did with my mortgage company while I was waiting for my new passport.</p>
<h3>Try Live Chat First</h3>
<p>A lot of companies have pages explaining how to change your name with them, which is usually something like &quot;Send us a letter in the post with a copy of your deed poll&quot; but if you ask them on live chat, a lot of them will do it without having to send them a physical letter like a caveman.</p>
<h3>You Won't Get Confirmation</h3>
<p>Of the seven places I've sent letters to, only one of them has actually confirmed that the change has happened, I had to call the others to confirm the change.</p>
<h3>Everyone Sucks Except Monzo</h3>
<p>I was able to change my name on Monzo within five minutes using the in-app chat. A week later, I'm still waiting for my high street bank to change even though I went in branch to make the change, which they force you to do.</p>
<h3>If All Else Fails, Say the Magic Word</h3>
<p>I also changed my email at the same time as my name, so I had to go through all my online accounts to change it.</p>
<p>If you find a company who refuses to change your name or email, say the magic word: GDPR. There are multiple companies who won't change your email address at all so it almost always ended in me sending an email something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have an obligation under GDPR to keep my personal information correct and up to date. If you're unable or unwilling to change my {name|email}, please delete my account as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, these companies would &quot;suddenly&quot; find a way to change it or, in a few cases, they would delete the account.</p>

<title>Convert a Spotify Account From Facebook to Email Login</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/convert-spotify-facebook-to-email-login/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/convert-spotify-facebook-to-email-login/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This morning <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/976392265374535680">I tweeted</a> that there's no way to convert a Spotify account from Facebook login to email and password login. I even spoke to Spotify support who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As your account was created via Facebook, it can't be unlinked. Don't worry, we can free up your email address so you can create a new account. Once that's done, we'll transfer all of your tunes and student details across.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I complained about this in one the Slack groups I'm in, and Nathaniel suggested I try doing a &quot;forgot password&quot; to set a password on the account and it worked. After that I was able to disconnect Spotify from the <a href="https://facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">Facebook settings page</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify website</a>, log out</li>
<li>Go to the login page and choose &quot;forgot password&quot; and use the email associated with your Facebook account</li>
<li>Reset your password from the email link</li>
<li>Disconnect Spotify in Facebook</li>
<li>Log in with your new password</li>
</ol>
<p>The above steps that I followed have also been confirmed to work by <a href="https://iwader.co.uk">Wade</a>.</p>

Last year I switched to Android, using a Pixel XL as my phone because I had become frustrated with some of the interface changes to iOS. Just under a year later I was as irked with Android as I previously was with iOS, but for different reasons (Seriously Android? No way to choose audio output is ridiculous). I also missed my Apple Watch and I wanted to try out AirPods which, surprising no one, I love.</p>
<p>One of the things I did like about Android is that every app you install doesn't have to be on the Home screen. I got pretty use to this so I now have my most used apps on first screen, everything else in a folder on the second, and I use spotlight to find those apps. This did have its downsides on Android though; some apps I would simply forget to check, or post to, so I've made an effort to put those apps on the Home screen on my iPhone, namely Instagram, Reddit, and Buzzfeed.</p>
<p>Starting with my dock, Overcast and Tweetbot were the apps I missed the most. The plethora of great podcast, and to some extent Twitter, clients on iOS isn't mirrored on Android and Pocketcasts is basically the only decent option. As much as I like Pocketcasts, Overcast works better for the way I like to listen and subscribe to podcasts. I do still have Pocketcasts and Castro installed so I can check out any new features and switch easily if I want to.</p>
<p>Mac counterparts isn't something offered by a lot of Android apps so coming back to iOS I was happy download Fantastical and PCalc although the latter isn't as much a calculator for me as it is a game that can also do calculations.</p>
<p>Before I used Android I was a plug-in-and-sync-from-iTunes person but I signed up for Spotify the day I got my Pixel and I've been using it ever since. I have considered Apple Music but it doesn't integrate with my Amazon Echo so that's a no-go, at least for now.</p>
<p>The rest of the apps are fairly self-explanatory; Amazon, eBay, and my bank's <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/927502202914123776">terrible app</a> because <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/701068051840630784">I buy a lot of Lego</a>, Google Inbox because email is a necessary evil, and notes because I like the simplicity of it.</p>
<p>Spending a year on Android gave me an appreciation for the things I really like about iOS as well as the areas I hope they improve on in the future like the Home screen layout and notifications.</p>

<title>Notes About Setting up RetroPie</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/notes-about-setting-up-retropie/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/notes-about-setting-up-retropie/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Setting up <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a> on a Raspberry Pi is fairly easy but I did come up against a couple of issues that I needed to fix. This post is just a collection of quick fixes for those issues.</p>
<h3>Remove underscored games when transferring from a Mac</h3>
<p>When copying ROMs from a Mac, you may end up with a bunch of files that start with an underscore. To remove them all, run the following:</p>
<pre><code>find /home/pi/RetroPie -name &quot;._*&quot; -exec rm -rf {} \;
</code></pre>
<p>[<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/4348/removing-_-files-from-rom/10">source</a>]</p>
<h3>Finding Installed Themes</h3>
<p>For the theme I'm using, I wanted to edit the SNES background image to use the non-US SNES (read: the one true SNES). Installed themes are stored in <code>/etc/emulationstation/themes</code>.</p>
<h3>Finding decent ROMs</h3>
<p>The best site I've found for searching for specific ROMs is <a href="http://www.completeroms.com/">Complete ROMS</a>. They don't have <em>everything</em> but the site is clean and easy to find exactly what you're looking for.</p>

<title>Getting Closer to the Perfect TV</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/getting-closer-to-the-perfect-tv/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/getting-closer-to-the-perfect-tv/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2015, Pieter Siekerman <a href="http://technology.siekerman.nl/post/133644449664/the-perfect-tv">wrote a blog post</a> describing what the perfect TV should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For two years now I’ve closely watched various TV manufacturers trying to find their way in the changing landscape of TV platforms and I just don’t get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In September, (and again this week), I ordered the <a href="https://hisense.co.uk/electronics/tvs/m3000/43">Hisense H43M3000</a> despite it being a relatively unknown brand in the UK and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was given the price of ~£300. This is the closest I've come to the perfect TV thus far, but it still has a long way to go based on Peter's list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all and most importantly, it should not be a TV platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, it is. It has built-in apps but no app store to download other apps. It's slow to load anything including switching inputs, which is infuriating. The remote is a hot mess of useless buttons including app-specific buttons like Netflix, YouTube and Wuaki which can't be changed to open a different app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large number of HDMI ports</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The TV has 4 HDMI ports but annoyingly only two of them support UHD/4K/HDR/whatever. I assume this is a cost-saving measure but if they removed the TV tuner or the &quot;common interface&quot; slot, whatever the hell that is, this would cover it. It does have a SCART socket, component, and 3 USB ports but I'd prefer to replace all of those with HDMI if I could. I can <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/863400075338371072">rename the inputs though</a> which is the best feature of this TV by a long shot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The display should be great</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The display is so nice I bought another one to replace my aging HDTV from ~5 year ago. Even with non-4K content, everything looks fantastic.</p>
<p>There are a number of other points on Peter's list which I care less about than the ones listed above and there's still a long way to go before I can buy the perfect TV. However, if you're looking for a good value 4K TV this is a pretty good option. Just buy yourself a Fire TV box to go with it so you can avoid thier &quot;smart&quot; software.</p>

<title>Enable HDR with PS4 on Hisense H43M3000</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/hdr-hisense-tv-ps4/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/hdr-hisense-tv-ps4/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My Hisense TV (<a href="https://hisense.co.uk/electronics/tvs/m3000/43">H43M3000</a>) recently received an update to support HDR, which is something the PS4 supports for some games. After plugging the console in, the PS4 told me my TV doesn't support HDR but after some playing around with settings and ports I managed to get it to work:</p>
<ol>
<li>The PS4 must be using either HDMI port 3 or 4</li>
<li>Open the TV settings and go to System then the &quot;HDMI &amp; CEC Function&quot; section</li>
<li>Select &quot;Adjust&quot; on the HDMI 2.0 Format setting and choose &quot;Enhanced Format&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I restarted the PS4 and TV, HDR was supported (and looked beautiful in <a href="http://media.rbbl.ws/game/2017/05/01/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>) 🎉.</p>
<p><s><em>nb: I have an <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/736500604705591297">original PS4</a> so I can't confirm if this TV works with 4K on the PS4 Pro.</em></s></p>
<p><strong>24/01/2018 Update: I now have a PS4 Pro and can confirm it works with 4K as well.</strong></p>

<title>Thoughts on OnePlus 3 and Switching to Android</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/oneplus-3-and-switching-to-android/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/oneplus-3-and-switching-to-android/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>If you want to hear more about this, or just prefer listening over reading (hi Myke), I spoke about this with John on episode 30 of our podcast, <a href="http://ruminatepodcast.com/31">Ruminate</a>. Find it in <a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1033235350/ruminate-podcast">Overcast</a>, <a href="http://pca.st/ruminate">Pocketcasts</a>, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/ruminate-podcast/id1033235350">iTunes</a>, or any other podcast app you use.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I wrote about <a href="http://robblewis.me/replacing-apps-on-android">replacing all my apps on Android</a> just under a week ago, but I wanted to lay out some of my thoughts about the <a href="https://oneplus.net/uk/3">OnePlus 3</a> and Android in general.</p>
<p>Firstly, I've had a few people ask <em>why</em> I switched to Android. There wasn't a single reason but a plethora of little things that started to bug me about iOS. First off, as I <a href="http://www.ruminatepodcast.com/30">discussed here</a>, I'm no longer using iTunes because of how buggy it is when downloading music, as well as it constantly messing up my album artwork. Without iTunes, the only thing locking me into iOS was iMessage and I realised I could live without it. After the &quot;upgrade&quot; to iOS10 a lot of things bugged me about it. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing notifications would sometimes not open the related app, they would just disappear</li>
<li>The feature where it would show Overcast on the lock screen when I plugged my headphones in no longer worked</li>
<li>Because iOS10 splits control center into two panels, whenever I opened it to use something it was inevitably on the wrong panel</li>
<li>No way to clear all notifications from the lock screen without 3D touch (without swiping down notification center which you can only do from the widget lock screen)</li>
<li>Widgets can't be placed wherever I want</li>
<li>Actions on notifications (reply, archive, etc) take twice as many presses to get to as before without 3D touch</li>
<li>Even with <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/262837/how-to-unlock-your-ios-10-device-with-a-single-click-like-in-ios-9/">rest to unlock</a> enabled, my iPhone still wouldn't always unlock properly, or at all</li>
<li>Fucking iMessage stickers and apps</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above made me hate using my phone and on top of all that the way I use my phone has changed significantly in the past year so I decided the best thing for me to do was to switch to Android.</p>
<h3>OnePlus 3</h3>
<p>I won't be going in depth into the phone but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIpOZY03OM">MKBHD reviewed it here</a>. The OnePlus is similar in size to the iPhone 7 plus and after a few days of using it my iPhone 6 felt ridiculously small; turns out Myke was right.</p>
<p>The OnePlus build quality is not quite as nice as an iPhone, which I expected, but it is still a really nice device. The thing I love the most about it is the fingerprint unlock. Not only has it never failed to read my fingerprint but it's also <em>really</em> fast, as you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOIfTNfdZUk">this video</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    
</div>
<p>Dash is OnePlus's quick charging feature that uses their <a href="https://oneplus.net/uk/3/dashcharge">dash charger and cable</a>. I'm able to charge my phone from ~15% to 70% in about 30 minutes, and another 15 to reach the full 100%. Because of this I've started charging my phone in the evening before I go to bed and the battery lasts the entirety of the next day well into the late evening before I need to charge again. It's worth noting that dash charging only works with both the USB plug <em>and</em> the dash cable, so it won't work with third-party USB cables.</p>
<p>OnePlus 3, like the previous models, has an alert slider on the side to switch between silent, priority notifications, and all notifications. This is really useful and not something that appears on a lot of Android phones (although the modes exist as a software feature). By default priority includes alarms, music, messages, and phone calls but any app can be treated as priority in the global notification settings. Coming from an iPhone, it's nice to have a physical switch and as someone who had a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310">old Nokia phones</a> I love having a modern equivalent of profiles. I use silent for when I'm sleeping, priority for when I'm at work, and all for any other time.</p>
<p>The OnePlus runs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxygenOS">OxygenOS</a> which is a slightly modified version of stock Android, currently on 6.0 Marshmallow. Although it's frustrating to not have the latest version of Android, I'm pretty happy with it and OnePlus have confirmed they are working on an Android N update which should be out in the next few months.</p>
<p>The camera is no iPhone competitor but the photos it takes <a href="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/one-plus-sample-cat.jpg">are pretty good</a>. I don't take a lot of photos with my phone so this isn't massively important to me, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p><img alt="One Plus cat sample image" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/one-plus-sample-cat-preview.jpg" /></p>
<p>Lets be honest, it's a slab of glass with some buttons next to it. It's not the world's greatest device but it's nowhere near the worst and for £330, you can't go wrong.</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>Android is much as you'd expect; it's a mobile operating system that has apps, widgets, notifications, just like iOS. There are, however, some significant differences. Some of them I like, some not so much.</p>
<p>Being able to install an app from the Google Play store from my Mac (and choose which device to install to) is so natural, and works so well, that I'm amazed Apple hasn't implemented this. Opening iTunes seems archaic in comparison. Once I'd downloaded a few apps, I was impressed with Google's ability to suggest apps tailored to my interests, something which Apple have been trying to do for years on the App Store with little success (remember <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/03/apple_turns_on_app_store_genius_recommendations_for_developers">Genius for Apps</a>?).</p>
<p>The home screen(s) is where Android differs significantly; I can put apps wherever I want, and have widgets all over the place. This is the biggest improvement using my phone day-to-day because if I only want four apps on the home screen, they don't have to be right at the top of the screen. The left-most home screen is Google Now which shows weather, news, and a host of other &quot;cards&quot; based on emails and apps I use (for example, it now shows me my eBay saved searches). It's supposed to show me delivery information based on my emails, but this <a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2015/07/06/gmail-google-now-package-tracking-card-is-showing-up-or-some-google-apps-users/">might be disabled for Google Apps accounts</a> so I don't get the benefit of this. I currently have two home screen; one with my most used apps and the <a href="https://pocketcasts.com">Pocketcasts</a> widget, and one with some lesser used apps and the <a href="https://spotify.com">Spotify</a> widget. Apps that aren't on either home screen can be accessed through search or from the app drawer.</p>
<p>Setting default apps is great (I swapped out the default SMS app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra&amp;hl=en_GB">Textra</a>) but the best part about setting defaults is opening specific type of links and files in specific apps. For example, all Twitter links open in Fenix and all Reddit links open in Relay. This is <em>so</em> much better than ending up on the mobile Twitter site when I have a perfectly good Twitter client installed. Talking of opening links, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkbubble.playstore&amp;hl=en_GB">Link Bubble</a> is fantastic. When I click a link in Twitter, for example, it shows a floating bubble on my screen which will expand once the page has loaded. Being able to scroll through Twitter, open a bunch of links, and then review them all at once is amazing.</p>
<p><img alt="Default links and Link Bubble" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/default-links-and-link-bubble.png" /></p>
<p>One of the things I thought I'd miss most is sending messages from my Mac through the Messages app. <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">Push Bullet</a> fixes this by allowing me to mirror all notifications to my Mac, send messages, send files between devices, and interact with the notifications just like I can on the phone. It also has a <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/pro">bunch of other really useful features</a>. I was concerned that apps like this might massively affect battery life, but this hasn't been the case.</p>
<p>Something I wasn't able to work out was how to choose where to output audio when I'm connected to a Bluetooth device. On iOS, the &quot;AirPlay&quot; menu serves this function. I looked around for a solution to this but came up short so if anyone knows of an app that might fix this, let me know. Speaking of Bluetooth, unlike iOS, there is no way to see the battery life of Bluetooth devices like headphones. Although not a huge problem, it's frustrating that Android lacks this feature.</p>
<p>On iOS both the banking apps I used, HSBC and Lloyds, allowed me to use TouchID to login. On Android, this isn't the case, despite Android having support for such a system (PayPal use it). This, I assume, is because not all Android phones have fingerprint sensors so there's a smaller market for it. Again, not something I can't deal with, but a pain none the less.</p>
<p>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the clusterfuck that is Amazon's presence on Android. I wanted to download the Amazon Video app but the Play Store said it wasn't compatible with my device, which seemed odd. When I asked <a href="https://danharper.me">Dan</a>, he informed me I should download it through the normal Amazon app. Except my Amazon app didn't have the option he showed me because I downloaded the Amazon app from the Play Store and not the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-com-Amazon-Underground/dp/B004GJDQT8">Amazon Underground</a> app which is a combination of the standard shopping app, plus an app store. To download the Underground app, I had to turn off the security setting to only allow apps from trusted sources. Then, and only then, was I able to download the Amazon Video app from inside <em>that</em> app. What.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with using Android. I don't do Real Work™ on my phone and mostly use it for Twitter, phone calls, and buying stuff on Amazon when I'm not at my Mac. Almost any problem or tweak I want to make I can through apps or widgets; Android definitely feels like it's geared more towards power users and people who want to tinker with settings or &quot;fix&quot; things but that's perfect for me.</p>
<p>Finally, because the Apple Watch doesn't work with Android, I'm getting rid of it. As I <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/783674253807845376">said on Twitter</a> the only thing I miss is not being able to quickly see the time so I'm currently eyeing up <a href="http://www.nixon.com/uk/en/sentry-leather-sw/A105SW.html?dwvar_A105SW_color=2244&amp;dwvar_A105SW_size=00#gclid=Cj0KEQjw1ee_BRD3hK6x993YzeoBEiQA5RH_BHLZjplqhtoBrlGuj7TgwFVJGVScjX9UVaU9d1tOVwgaAmee8P8HAQ&amp;start=1">one of these</a>.</p>

<title>Replacing Apps on Android</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/replacing-apps-on-android/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/replacing-apps-on-android/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/home-screen-tiles.png" /></p>
<p>If you follow me on Twitter, you probably already know I've ditched my iPhone in favour of a <a href="https://oneplus.net/uk/3">OnePlus 3</a>. The biggest hurdle to switching is the apps I used regularly (and some not-so-regularly). After <a href="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/apps.md">making a list of apps I had installed</a> on my iPhone, I was able to filter it down to just two lists: ones with no equivalent, and ones I needed to find an Android alternative for. The three with no equivalent were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Store</li>
<li>Blink</li>
<li>Plot</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these will make a massive difference to my life, but I will definitely miss <a href="http://squibner.com/blink/">Blink</a> and <a href="http://plotapp.io/">Plot</a>. The following apps are ones I need replacements for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Notes</li>
<li><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=twitter">Clear</a></li>
<li><a href="http://junecloud.com/support/deliveries-ios/">Deliveries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dueapp.com/">Due</a></li>
<li><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.itvshowsapp.com/">iTV Shows</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8">Narwhal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't been able to find anything that is as easy for creating lists as Clear but <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a>'s lists feature does the job reasonably well and also doubles as a good replacement for Apple's notes app.</p>
<p><img alt="Google Inbox' inline delivery information" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/google-inbox-inline-delivery.jpg" /></p>
<p>I switched to <a href="https://inbox.google.com">Google Inbox</a> prior to buying the OnePlus and it manages to show delivery tracking inline with the email so I decided I didn't need Deliveries anymore. <a href="https://danharper.me">Dan</a> also told me Google Now should tell me about my deliveries based on my email, but I haven't seen that working yet. Google Now also has a reminders feature, which has mostly replaced Due.</p>
<p>The stock <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en_GB">Google calendar</a> app and widget replaced Fantastical for what I needed with no problems.</p>
<p>Tweetbot is a solid app and I knew finding a decent alternative would be hard given Twitter's disdain for third party developers. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.mvilla.android.fenix">Fenix for Twitter</a> has most of the features I want from a Twitter app, and the design is fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fema.serietv2">TV Series</a>, as of right now, seems like a pretty good app although I'll need a few more weeks to know if it works as well as iTV Shows which I was using on iOS. Overcast and Narwhal are both fantastic apps, but also reasonably easy to find quality Android equivalents. I replaced them with <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/web/podcasts/index">Pocketcasts</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news&amp;hl=en_GB">Relay</a> respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really pleased so many of the apps I used have Android and iOS versions, because it made switching <em>much</em> easier. And, despite what some in the Apple community have you believe, the Android-only apps that I've tried are really great quality and on par with their iOS equivalents. And someone should show Apple how great installing apps from the Google Play site is, because it's a damn sight easier than opening iTunes.</p>

<title>Amazon Echo Initial Thoughts</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/amazon-echo-initial-thoughts/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/amazon-echo-initial-thoughts/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I have no self control so I bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo-Black/dp/B01GAGVIE4/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=echo&amp;qid=1475139825">Echo</a> while Amazon were offering £50 off for Prime members last week. Here's a brain dump of my initial thoughts on the device.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Setup is pretty easy using the <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=twitter">Alexa app</a>. The Echo creates it's own wifi network which you need to connect to so you can choose your home wifi network. Once that's done, you can connect services and products like Spotify and Hue lights from within the app, as well as add additional &quot;skills&quot; (Skills are what Amazon call apps for the Echo).</p>
<h3>Spotify</h3>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/551frl/my_initial_thoughts_on_the_amazon_echo_uk/d88129p?context=3">/u/jennorocks pointed out</a>, if you say the word &quot;playlist&quot; when asking for a playlist, it works pretty well.</p>
<p>I linked my Spotify account in the Alexa app and once setup, I was able to do a two things with it: either tell Alexa to play music on Spotify (playlist, artist, album, genre) or start playing through <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/">Spotify Connect</a> which sees the Echo as a device from within the Spotify app. Getting Alexa to play one of my saved playlists was difficult as it seems to just search Spotify and play the first search result. For example, I have a playlist called &quot;90s Hits&quot; but it kept playing a similarly named playlist. I don't know if there's some trick to force it play my playlists, but I haven't found it yet.</p>
<h3>Bluetooth</h3>
<p>The Echo also functions as a bluetooth speaker. Saying &quot;Alexa, pair my device&quot; will turn on the Echo's discovery mode which I could then select from my phone's bluetooth settings. The Echo can then control my phone playback by asking Alexa to play or pause. If my phone is disconnected from the Echo (e.g. if I leave the house), when I come back I can say &quot;Alexa, connect to my phone&quot; and the Echo will reconnect.</p>
<h3>Everything else</h3>
<p>Alexa understood every command I gave her <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/781140637089423360">including when we played around with it in the office</a> and you can see a list of commands you've asked in the Alexa app, which has Google Now-style cards with extra information for some things like traffic, timers, or shopping lists.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to using <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to automate some tasks such as moving my Alexa shopping list items to <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> but IFTTT doesn't currently support Echo in the UK which is disappointing, but IFTTT say they're working on it. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>The Alexa app is pretty slow and janky (it's a web app in a wrapper) but it's only used for setup of the device, and adding new skills. You can access the &quot;app&quot; from <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com">alexa.amazon.com</a> as well if you prefer to setup from a browser.</p>
<p>I don't currently have any smart home devices so I wasn't able to try these features out, but given how well everything else works I'm sure this will work equally well. The Echo does feel like somewhat of a novelty right now, but it works as a Spotify device, bluetooth speaker, and for timers while I'm cooking so I'm pretty happy with it.</p>

<title>Saving Money on Lego in the UK</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/saving-money-on-lego-in-the-uk/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/saving-money-on-lego-in-the-uk/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although there always seems to be some great Lego bargains to be had in the US from the likes of Walmart and Target, the UK doesn't really have equivalent stores that do reductions like those stores do. But there are a number of ways to save significant money on Lego in the UK.</p>
<h3>Lego VIP Points</h3>
<p>Lego's <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/VIP">VIP points</a> is a points system where for every £1 you spend (either online or in an official Lego store) you get 1 point. When you have 100 points, you get £5 off a purchase. Usually twice a year (around March and September), Lego run a double points promotion, so for every pound, you get 2 points; these promotions are a good time (if you have the willpower to wait) to order larger, Lego-exclusive sets or place a large order. So depending on how and when you order, you can get 5%-10% back in money off of other purchases. Being a VIP member also allows you early-access to exclusive sets, normally a few weeks early.</p>
<p>Although VIP is an always-on promotion, I personally buy from Lego for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A double VIP points promotion is running</li>
<li>When a free gift with a purchase is being offered — if the free gift (normally a polybag) is difficult, or not available, elsewhere they tend to sell for between £10-£15 on eBay. Personally, I would rather buy extra Lego with that money and get the polybag free, rather than spending the money on the polybag on it's own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery times when buying online can be anywhere from a few days to nearly two weeks.</li>
<li>Discounts and sales are few and far between so saving money on a specific set can be difficult</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/VIP/registration/index.jsp?joinow=true">Sign up to become a VIP member here</a></p>
<h3>Amazon, CamelCamelCamel and Brickset</h3>
<p>A significant portion of the Lego I buy comes from Amazon for one reason: discounts. Lego sets sold by Amazon <em>always</em> become discounted by at least 10%; with non-licensed themes like City or Friends, the discounts can go as high as 30%.</p>
<p>To guarantee I save money on Lego bought from Amazon, I do two things: add all the sets I want to a wish list (so I can manually check the prices every week) and install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-camelizer/ghnomdcacenbmilgjigehppbamfndblo?hl=en">CamelCamelCamel Chrome extension</a>. <a href="http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> (herein referred to as CCC) is a site that tracks prices on Amazon and can alert you when a product reaches a certain price.</p>
<p>To setup a price watch on Amazon, go to the product page and click the CCC button in the Chrome toolbar. This will show a price history graph for the product, and below that you can set a price that you want to be alerted at. CCC will send you an email when the product is available at that price.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/camelcamelcamel.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you use Brickset's wanted sets functionality (<a href="https://rknight.me/posts/manage-your-lego-collection-with-brickset">read our guide to Brickset here</a>), visit their <a href="http://brickset.com/buy/amazon">Amazon shopper page</a>, check the &quot;Sets on my wanted list only&quot; checkbox and Brickset will show you the current Amazon price for sets from your wanted list.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon doesn't generally sell the Lego-exclusive sets (although sometimes third-parties sell them but they're usually above retail price)</li>
<li>If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime, you have to pay postage for orders under £20.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hot UK Deals and Retailer Promotions</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hotukdeals.com/">Hot UK Deals</a> app allows you to setup notifications based on keywords. By setting &quot;Lego&quot; as one of your keywords, any time a deal is posted containing the word Lego, you'll get a notifications.</p>
<p>A lot of the UK supermarkets sell Lego, so when they get reduced, someone always posts it pretty quickly to Hot UK Deals. Something to look out for here is that some of the deals will be store specific so may not be applicable to you. However, when a retailer is doing 3 for 2 on Lego (like Tesco did recently), this can be a great time to save a significant amount of money on sets you want.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifications can be hit or miss; there are a lot of deals on the Lego video games so those will show up as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/hot-uk-deals.png" /></p>
<h3>Flubit</h3>
<p><a href="https://flubit.com">Flubit</a> is a site that tries to get you a better price than Amazon are currently offering. You give them a link to a product on Amazon, and they come back with a better offer. Read their <a href="https://flubit.com/about#!/how-it-works">How it Works</a> page to find out more. I've only used Flubit once, but I saved 20% on a set that was full-price on Amazon.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your order could come from any retailer so delivery might not be very quick.</li>
</ul>
<h3>eBay: Sets with no minifigures</h3>
<p>If a set you want it out of your price range, you're not interested in the minifigures, or you particularly like a specific vehicle from a set, eBay can be a great place to pick these up. Lots of people buy sets, take out the minifgures, and then sell the sets on their without them. For example, I picked up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/38wvv6/i_wasnt_planning_on_getting_any_jurassic_world/">all these Jurassic World sets</a> with no figures/dinosaurs for £35. Even used for spares, this was a great price. Set up eBay saved searches for what you're looking for, be patient, and you can get some great deals.</p>
<h3>Individual Minifigures</h3>
<p>There are three places I buy individual minifigures:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theminifigurestore.co.uk?affiliates=18">The Minifigure Store</a>: Prices are competitive with Bricklink and they run money off promotions through their Twitter account on a regular basis.</li>
<li><a href="http://bricklink.com">Bricklink</a>: Bricklink is best place to pick up spare pieces as well as individual minifigures. If you're buying just one minifigure, the price with postage can be the same as the Minifigure store/eBay, but buying a few at a time can have some good savings. Read our <a href="http://guidetobricklink.com">Guide to Bricklink</a> to find out about buying from Bricklink.</li>
<li><a href="http://ebay.co.uk">eBay</a>: Prices are slightly higher than Bricklink, but most of the times postage is free and just-released minifigures are generally available within a few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>For smaller sets, it can be more economical to just buy the complete set, even if you only want the minifigures</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collectible Series Minifigures</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Collectable-Minifigures">Lego's collectible minifigures</a> are hugely popular but have one large disadvantage: they come in blind bags so unless you can get really good at feeling for a specific one (I'm terrible at it), you can end up with a lot of duplicates.</p>
<p>If you want individual minifigures from a series, see the advice above. But if, like me, you like to collect the whole series, I've found that by watching auctions on eBay, I can pick up a whole series for around £45 (I never pay more than £48), which works out at just under £3 a minifigure. The collectible minifigures are usually priced at £2.50 so this might not seem like a money-saving tip, but if you end up with more than two duplicates when trying to buy the blind bags, then this will save you money.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>If there is a specific set you're looking for that is recently retired, or isn't discounted in the places listed above, these are the retailers I tend to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debenhams.com/">Debenhams</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smythstoys.com/">Smyths</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.toysrus.com/">Toys R Us</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/">John Lewis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ocado.com/">Ocado</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've had some luck checking Tesco's reduced section (assuming your local Tesco sells Lego) where some store-specific reductions can happen on smaller Lego sets and Sainsbury's tend to reduce all their Lego once every 3 months or so as well.</p>

<title>Convert LXF to Bricklink XML</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/convert-lxf-to-bricklink-xml/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/convert-lxf-to-bricklink-xml/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you've created a model in Lego Digital Designer, you likely want get those parts into a Bricklink wanted list so you can order them. Unfortunately, LDD doesn't have an option to export to the required <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?helpID=207">Bricklink XML format</a>. Thankfully, <a href="http://rebrickable.com">Rebrickable</a> has the ability to convert an LDD model to Bricklink XML. You'll need a Rebrickable account to do this, so if you haven't got one yet, <a href="http://rebrickable.com/signup">register for one</a>, and sign in.</p>
<p>Once you're signed in, choose &quot;My Private MOCs&quot; from the account dropdown menu and click &quot;Add New Private MOC&quot;, give it a name, and then press &quot;Save Details&quot;. Below this you will see a number of import options, but for the purposes of this article, we'll be focusing only on the LXF import. Click &quot; Import from MPD/LDR/LXF file&quot;, choose your LXF file from your computer, and press &quot;import&quot;.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/rebrickable-import.jpg" /></p>
<p>Rebrickable will then show all the parts from the model and indicate if any colours you've used don't exist. To fix any errornous colours, click on the part and choose a valid colour from the dropdown, and hit &quot;Save&quot;. This is also a good time to change the colour of any parts that Rebrickable marks as &quot;rare&quot; — you may want to switch to a more common colour to make it easier to buy.</p>
<p>Once you're happy with your part list, click &quot;Add to your Bricklink Wanted List&quot;. A window will popup allowing you to login to Bricklink. You can choose to add them to an existing list, or create a new one from this window. Once you click &quot;Add parts&quot;, a message will confirm that the parts have been added, and there will be a button to view your wanted list.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/rebrickable-add-to-list.jpg" /></p>
<p>Want to learn more about buying on Bricklink? Check out my in-depth guide at <a href="http://guidetobricklink.com">GuideToBricklink.com</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Update: When this post was written, I didn't realise Rebrickable had a feature to automatically add parts to a Bricklink wanted list.</strong></p>
<p><s>Once you're happy with your part list, click &quot;Export to Bricklink (XML)&quot; and your parts list will be downloaded in the correct format to import into Bricklink.</s></p>
<p>If you want to upload the parts list to a specific wanted list on Bricklink, you will need to edit the XML file in a text editor (I recommend <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>). You'll need to add <code>&lt;WANTEDLISTID&gt;12345&lt;/WANTEDLISTID&gt;</code> to every part in the XML file, where <code>12345</code> refers to your Bricklink wanted list ID.</p>
<p>Once all that is done, you can <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/wantedXML.asp">upload it to Bricklink</a>.</p>

<title>Third Party Apple Watch Bands Review</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/third-party-apple-watch-bands/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/third-party-apple-watch-bands/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/apple-watch-bands.jpg" /></p>
<p>When I first saw the <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/09/09Apple-and-Herm-s-Unveil-the-Apple-Watch-Herm-s-Collection.html">Hermès Cuff for Apple Watch</a> I thought it looked like a great watch band but also knew that there was no way I was going to pay upwards of a thousand pounds for one. So I kept an eye on eBay, looking for third party manufacturers making similar bands. These became available for purchase about a month after the announcement so I decided to order one. The seller also had some other copies of Apple's bands and I ordered a blue sport band, a black Milanese loop, as well as a pair of black adaptors to better match my space grey sport watch.</p>
<h3>Leather Cuff (£20)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/301765700770?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;var=600584661853&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">eBay link</a></p>
<p>I haven't seen the Hermès band in real life so I can only compare against photos but this band is more or less identical in design to the Hermès version. But as you might imagine, it feels cheap. The leather is pretty thin, not particularly soft, and it's generally uncomfortable to wear. The buckle feels like a toy from a Christmas cracker. There are some third party version that are around the £100 mark that would likely not have these issues but something I did notice whilst wearing the band, is that because of the way the band is designed my Apple Watch sits significantly higher on my wrist then when I using a sport band. I found this to be annoying and it's possible that the Hermès version has the same problem.</p>
<h3>Black Milanese (£20)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/301743856877?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;var=600570788016&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">eBay link</a></p>
<p>Apple only makes the Milanese loop milanese loop in one colour, so for someone like me with the space grey watch, my only option for a milanese loop is third party. The band I ordered is comfortable, but it <em>does</em> feel like it costs. There are some more expensive options available but I can't speak for how these compare to this one. The magnet is strong, but the materials used for the band itself just aren't that great and can get uncomfortable with continued use.</p>
<h3>Blue Sport Band (£5)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/301743860511?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;var=600570790558&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">eBay link</a></p>
<p>After trying the leather cuff and seeing how cheap it felt, I was surprised to find that the sport band from the same seller felt great. The design is identical in every way to the official version and feels more or less the same when wearing it. The only noticeable difference between this one and the Apple version is that Apple's feels a little bit thicker and sturdier. The band doesn't fit quite as snugly is the slots as it's official counterpart, but it's still feels sturdy. It's just as comfy as Apple's and at £5, it's a bargain.</p>
<p>These bands are fine if you want something that's not a sport band and aren't willing to spend out the money for the offical onces but overall, you get what you pay for. I think, as usual, <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/56">Myke was right</a>. I'm going to stick to sport bands for the forseeable future. They're much more comfortable to wear for an extended period and that's more important to me than anything else.</p>

<title>Game Controller Double Standards</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/game-controller-double-standards/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/game-controller-double-standards/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The new Apple TV supports game controllers which is great. What's not so great is the fact that developers can't require them. By not allowing developers to require a game controller, what Apple have done is limited the platform and the games produced for it. I bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HJ162ZM/A/steelseries-nimbus-wireless-gaming-controller">Nimbus controller</a> so I could play games like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/rayman-adventures./id973020044?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=twitter">Rayman Adventures</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/asphalt-8-airborne/id610391947?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=twitter">Asphalt 8</a> but I only ever use 1 or 2 buttons on the controller in any given game. It's unreasonable to expect developers to have one set of controls for the Siri remote and another for a controller, without changing the game significantly to support this.</p>
<p>Guitar Hero, however, is allowed to require a controller but not a standard MFi controller; Guitar Hero requires a purpose-built controller that presumably won't be able to be used for other games on Apple TV (except more Guitar Hero games). This kind of double standard is frustrating for both developers and owners of the Apple TV and I hope Apple decide to reverse their decision on not requiring game controllers soon.</p>

<title>Tips for Apple TV App Developers</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/tips-for-apple-tv-app-developers/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/tips-for-apple-tv-app-developers/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the Apple TV got released I have been running <a href="http://atvapps.net">Apple TV Apps</a>, a blog and Twitter account showcasing the best Apple TV apps available. With discoverability being sub-par compared to the iOS app store, the site has been moderately successful and I've been contacted by a number of developers with iTunes links to their apps asking me to feature them, but there's a problem. Those links don't go anywhere; no web previews, no way to view these apps in iTunes.</p>
<p><img alt="Connecting to iTunes" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/connecting-to-itunes.png" /></p>
<p>Graham Spencer summed up what is needed from developers really well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple TV developers, <em>please</em> make sure you have a landing page with screenshots, info, price and press kit!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The page doesn't have to be the most beautiful website in the world but the information needs to be available if you expect your app to be featured anywhere. There are a number of options to get a simple website up and running with very little effort.</p>
<h3>Free options</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Although Wordpress and Tumblr are both blogging platforms, they can be used as landing pages with a little bit of tweaking in the settings.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> - If you know some HTML and CSS, you can get a GitHub pages site up in a matter of minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paid options</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://squarespace.com/coverpage">Squarespace</a> - Their cover page starts at just $5 a month and is perfect for an app landing page.</li>
<li>Roll your own - If you're comfortable with setting everything up yourself, you can build and host your own website. <a href="https://hover.com/scHIv4WR">Hover</a> is a great option for domains and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=8e1d8283bd20">Digital Ocean</a> offer one-click installs for loads of web applications like Wordpress and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<p>At a minimum, you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few screenshots of the various parts of your apps (ideally the same ones featured in the store)</li>
<li>A description of your app (again, the same description as you have in the app store is ideal)</li>
<li>The price — this is a more difficult one because of pricing in different countries, but put the price in at least one currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other things that will help market your app:</p>
<ul>
<li>A video of your app. This is useful for helping people decide whether they want to but your app or not.</li>
<li>A press kit. This is normally a zip file which includes all the the above information (screenshots, description, video) as well as your app icon and any other marketing materials you might have.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example that fits all of these criteria, check out the <a href="http://almostimpossible.co/">landing page for Almost Impossible!</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Almost Impossible Landing Page" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/almost-impossible.png" /></p>
<p>Until Apple allows web previews for Apple TV apps, your goal should be to replicate all of the information you have in the app store. If you at least some of the above, your app is much more likely to be featured and also it will help customers decide if they want to buy your app.</p>

<p><em>My iPhone home screen as of September 2015. This post originally appeared in the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/club/">MacStories newsletter (now Club MacStories)</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/homescreen-september-2015.jpg" target="_blank"><img height="auto" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/homescreen-september-2015.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" width="250" /></a></p>
<p>I like to try and keep all of my apps on one page, hence the large number of folders. In the fight between quick access to apps and tidiness, tidiness always wins. Having said that, I do still like to keep my most used apps one tap away. The empty bottom row is used primarly for apps that I'm trying out which, at the moment, happens to be <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bf-news/id981609476?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">BuzzFeed News</a>.</p>
<p>Because I only have one screen of apps, my dock is less important than if I had multiple pages. I have always kept phone and Safari in those spots and as I've added more messaging apps (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Slack</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Snapchat</a>) the Messages app has been replaced by a folder to contain them all. Similarly, because I switch between listening to podcasts in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Overcast</a> and music, all media-related apps go into the media folder in the dock.</p>
<p>The app I use the most is definitely <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter.-elegant/id722294701?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Tweetbot</a>; I spend a lot of time on Twitter so I need to be able to get to it quickly. I also regulary catch on a number of subreddits and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Narwhal</a> is easily the best Reddit client I've found as the official one is far too confusing. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Clear</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Fantastical</a> are the best apps in their respective categories and I wouldn't even considering removing them from the home screen. Although I don't use it as much as Tweetbot or Narwhal, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plot-discover-track-movies/id922985808?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Plot</a> is a fantastic app for keeping track of movies I want to watch and ones that I have watched.</p>
<p><a href="https://simplecast.fm">Simplecast</a> is a saved web site and not a native application, but I like to check up on the download numbers for <a href="http://ruminatepodcast.com">my podcast</a> so that earns a spot on my home screen. Some of the other apps that are hidden away that I use regularly include <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/due-reminders-countdown-timers/id390017969?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Due</a>, a simple but really powerful reminders app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blink-better-affiliate-links/id946766863?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Blink</a> for generating iTunes affiliate links and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deliveries-a-package-tracker/id290986013?mt=8&amp;at=1001l3gY&amp;ct=blog">Deliveries</a> for tracking parcels.</p>
<p>The background is a Star-Lord wallpaper (that I also use <a href="https://hellsite.rknight.me/635851605364051968">on my desktop</a>) and you can <a href="http://justinmaller.com/project/helmetica/">download it here</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This might change in the future (podcasts are harder than they seem) but for now we'll be talking about how technology helps solve problems, as well as some non-tech related topics like terrible food, and why you would save a pair of shoes for 10 years.</p>

<title>Manage Your LEGO Collection with Brickset</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/manage-your-lego-collection-with-brickset/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/manage-your-lego-collection-with-brickset/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://brickset.com/">Brickset</a>, as well as being a great source for LEGO news and reviews, is a also an excellent service for keeping a list of all the sets and minifigures that you own. Brickset also has some more advanced features for marking sets that you own without minifigures and custom flags to make managing your collection even easier. Once you've set up your collection, you can also share it publicly if you desire. For example, <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-rmlewisuk">here is my collection</a>. If you haven't already, <a href="http://brickset.com/signup">signup for a Brickset account</a>.</p>
<h2>Sets</h2>
<p>There are a number of different ways you can search for sets to add them to your collection: by set number, by set name or by tag. To add a set to your collection, type the set name or number into the search box and once you've found the set you want to add, simply check the &quot;I own&quot; checkbox and it will be added to your collection. A large number of sets on Brickset are also tagged to make searching for a set easier; if you type <code>Emmet</code> into the search box you will see <code>Emmet Brickowski [Tag]</code> as one of the suggestions. Selecting this option will show you <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/tag-Emmet-Brickowski">all sets that contain an Emmet minifigure</a>. You can then view a list of all the sets you by selecting <code>Sets you own</code> from the <code>My sets</code> menu. You can also set up a wanted list of sets by checking the <code>I want</code> checkbox: your wanted list can be found by selecting <code>Sets you want</code> from the <code>My sets</code> menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/brickset-search.png"><img alt="brickset-search.png" src="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/brickset-search.png" /></a></p>
<p>Once you've added a set, you will also be able to view a list of all the minifigures you own by going to <a href="http://brickset.com/minifigs/mycollection-owned">brickset.com/minifigs/mycollection-owned</a>. Brickset will automatically work out which minifigures you have based on the sets you own. However, if you're like me, you may on occasion buy a set without the minifigures and Brickset has a feature to cope with this: flags.</p>
<h3>Custom Flags and No Minifigures</h3>
<p>Flags are a way for you to add extra metadata to the sets you own. To set up flags, go to <a href="http://brickset.com/mycollection">brickset.com/mycollection</a> and select <code>Set up flags</code>. Brickset allows you up to four custom flags: I have a <code>Bricklinked</code> flag for noting when I bought the parts of a set from <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/">Bricklink</a>, a <code>To build</code> flag to note when I haven't yet opened a set and a <code>Maybe</code> flag to use in conjunction with my wanted list. The blue flag has an extra checkbox to make the flag indicate that you don't own the minifigures for a set. By using this flag, Brickset will not show that you own the minifigures from any set with this flag applied.</p>
<p><a href="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/brickset-flags.png"><img alt="brickset-flags.png" src="http://studshq.s3.amazonaws.com/brickset-flags.png" /></a></p>
<h2>Loose Minifigures</h2>
<p>If you have purchased a minifigure individually, there are two ways you can add this to your minifigures collection. The first is to find the set the minifigure comes from, select the <code>minifigures</code> tab from the set page, and check the <code>I own</code> checkbox. These will be added to your minifigure collection. The second method is to search by the name of the minifigure: simply change the search dropdown to <code>minifigs</code>. Once you have found the minifigure you want to add to your collection, simple check the  <code>I own</code> checkbox.</p>
<h2>Custom lists</h2>
<p>Once you've set up your collection, you can filter by theme, year and sort it by various different methods (e.g. number of pieces). This is great for sets that are directly linked together by something official like a theme, but if you want to create a custom list  of sets, or BrickLists as Brickset calls them, you can. For example, I've made <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/list-12524">a list of the sets given away with the Daily Mail last year</a> for my own reference. To create a new BrickList, select <code>BrickLists</code> from <code>My Menu</code> and then select <code> Create new BrickList</code>. Give your list a title and description and then you can start adding sets to it. You can choose to make it public or keep it private.</p>
<h2>Find out if you own a specific part</h2>
<p>As an additional bonus of having catalogued your collection, if you are looking for a specific part, Brickset will tell you which sets that you own contain that part you are looking for. Change the search dropdown to <code>part</code>, find the part you want to find, choose a colour and then select <code>View sets in your collection that contain this part</code>.</p>
<h2>Collection Summary</h2>
<p>Now you've added all your sets and minifigures, you can view your collection summary by selecting <code>Collection summary</code> from the <code>My Sets</code> menu. This summary will show you, by theme, the total cost of the sets you own, the total numbers of sets in a theme and how many of them you own as well as a number of other data points. Fair warning: if you don't want to know how much you've spent on LEGO, avoid this page.</p>

<guid>https://rknight.me/simple-git-deploy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is a simple way to deploy to a remote server, more for my reference than anything else.</p>
<p>Create a new folder on the server and initialise a bare git repository in it.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /root/repos/project-name
cd /root/repos/project-name
git init --bare
</code></pre>
<p>Create a post-receive hook (<code>nano /hooks/post-receive</code>) with this as the contents:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
REPO=/root/repos/project-name
TMP_GIT_CLONE=/tmp/project-name
PUBLIC_DIR=/var/www/project-name

git clone $REPO $TMP_GIT_CLONE
cp -rp $TMP_GIT_CLONE/* $PUBLIC_DIR
rm -rf $TMP_GIT_CLONE
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to create the public directory if it doesn't already exist. Then add the remote to your local repo.</p>
<pre><code>git remote add live ssh@server:/root/repos/project-name
</code></pre>

<title>Remove Laravel Homestead Environment Variables</title>

<guid>https://rknight.me/remove-homestead-environment-variables/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you add environment variables to Laravel homestead, they get added so you can access them within your applications. The problem is, if you delete a varaible from your <code>homestead.yaml</code> file, it doesn't get deleted within Homestead. If you need to remove them, you can delete them from <code>php-fpm.conf</code> located at <code>/etc/php5/fpm/php-fpm.conf</code>.</p>

<title>Stig Quote Generator</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/stig-quote-generator/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/stig-quote-generator/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This morning, I was watching Top Gear and decided it would be fun to create the <a href="http://code.robblewis.me/stig-quotes/">Stig quote generator</a>. I grabbed all the &quot;some say&quot; quotes from the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Top_Gear">Top Gear Wikiquote</a> page and split them into two parts (the &quot;some say&quot; part and the &quot;and that&quot; parts). The generator then grabs two of them at random, one of each type, and joins them together. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some say that his heart is in upside down, and that if he felt like it he could fire Alan Sugar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rmlewisuk/stig-quotes">code is on GitHub</a> if that's your thing.</p>

<title>UltraViolet: Everything is Not Awesome</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/ultraviolet/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/ultraviolet/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Joe Steel <a href="http://joe-steel.com/2015-02-20-Discs-not-Included.html">wrote about digital content</a> following an interview with a Kevin Tsujihara, CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, he highlights that they’re still trying to push hard on UltraViolet. Consumers have roundly rejected this as any kind of solution. Disney, Google, and Apple won’t participate — but sure, let’s prop this sucker up, Weekend at Bernie’s style! It is a farce of a system that has wronged many that dare to use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joe and Dan also spoke about how bad UltraViolet is on <a href="http://defocused.co/defocused/ep-36-youre-a-soldier-arry.html">this week's Defocused</a> so I thought I would take the oppurtunity to get an UltraViolet copy of The Lego Movie that came with the blu ray I bought. The UltraViolet slip in the blu ray suggests to &quot;instantly stream or download&quot; it takes &quot;3 easy steps&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://flixter.com/getuv">http://flixter.com/getuv</a></li>
<li>Enter the code</li>
<li>Follow the instructions</li>
</ol>
<p>Step one and two went smoothly. The page at stage two noted that the UltraViolet download is for the &quot;cinema version&quot; only although it wasn't clear if the blu ray version was different. I was informed I would have to create <em>two</em> accounts, Flixter and UltraViolet. These are for &quot;<em>storing your film and TV collection in the cloud</em>&quot; and to &quot;<em>stream and download your UltraViolet Digital Collection to your favourite compatible screens</em>&quot; respectively.</p>
<p>Signing up for a Flixter account requires a name, email addrees and date of birth; this data can be used for the UltraViolet account as well, which is convenient. Alternatively, you can login with Facebook which asks for access to your profile, friends list and email address, or Google Plus which requests access to a list of all the people in your circles. To finalise the account(s) creation, the terms and conditions that you must agree to state (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I accept UltraViolet's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; agree to allow Flixster to link to my UltraViolet account and allow me to manage it through Flixster; and <strong>request that Flixster and Warner Bros. send me offers</strong> and make product recommendations and use my UltraViolet account information for such purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On submission an error told me &quot;<em>The UV username is not valid.</em>&quot;. I subsequently received an email asking me to confirm my Flixter account. Ignoring the error, I confirmed the account and was prompted to link my UltraViolet account, which I'm pretty sure didn't exist. It didn't.&quot;<em>Your connection to UltraViolet needs to be reset. Please click here to resolve this issue.</em>&quot; Flixter told me. The same UltraViolet linking page was presented with no way to sign up for a new account so I Googled for the <a href="https://www.uvvu.com/signup">sign up page</a> and filled in the form. Success. Back to Flixter to link my brand new UltraViolet account, which worked this time and then redirected back to Flixter where I can finally view my collection. Of no movies. Nothing there. The code I originally entered hadn't worked so I selected &quot;redeem&quot; from the main menu.</p>
<p>Redemption of a code on Flixter requires searching for the movie in their database rather than just entering the code directly. Then back to the UltraViolet site to enter the code again. After a few minutes of &quot;updating my collection&quot; I finally had the Lego Movie available to watch in my collection.</p>
<p>This whole process took me about 40 minutes for &quot;3 easy steps&quot;. Everything is not awesome, Mr. Tsujihara. Not even close.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yosemite Mail will sometimes show Gmail outgoing mail as being offline when you first setup a Gmail account. To fix this open up Mail and do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open preferences and go to Accounts.</li>
<li>Select &quot;Edit SMTP Server List&quot; from the &quot;Outgoing Mail Server Dropdown&quot;.</li>
<li>Select &quot;Advanced&quot; and put your account password in the password input.</li>
<li>Voila, all fixed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For some reason, Mail doesn't always save the password here on setup, so these are steps required to fix it.</p>

<title>Thoughts on Google Chromecast</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/thoughts-on-chromecast/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/thoughts-on-chromecast/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chromecast got released in the UK on Wednesday and I bought one, in the hopes it will be better than the plethora of other streaming devices I have (Apple TV, Google TV, Xbox 360, PS3). As a side note, the Google TV, specifically <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/support/en/product/NSZ-GS7">this model</a> is the worst peice of equipment I've ever owned.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>The Chromecast is really easy to setup; plug in the dongle into an HDMI port, plug in the power cable (either USB or mains) and turn your TV on. Then go to <a href="http://chromecast.com/setup">chromecast.com/setup</a> and follow the instructions. I set it up on my Mac so I can't vouch for the Windows setup, but I think it'd be pretty similar. Download and run the companion Mac app, setup your preferred wifi network, let any Chromecast updates run and you're good to go. None of the setup is done on the Chromecast itself, so there's no bullshit of trying to put in your wifi password with an on screen keyboard.</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<p>Google lists a number of apps <a href="http://chromecast.com/apps">on the Chromecast site</a> that have support for the Chromecast but the ones I am most interested in were BBC iPlayer, Netflix, Plex and YouTube.
If you've ever used AirPlay on an iOS device, using Chromecast is just as simple. In any supported app, select the &quot;cast button&quot;, choose your Chromecast from the list and the video will start playing through your TV.</p>
<p>YouTube, Netflix and BBC iPlayer were fairly straight forward and worked without a hitch. Plex required me to update the server on my Mac to the latest version (I hadn't updated it for over a year). You can also use the Chromecast within Chrome on the desktop by installing the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd">Chromecast extension</a>.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of Chromecast over AirPlay to an Apple TV is the ability to leave the app your streaming from and do other things. When AirPlaying video, the app your streaming from has to be open the whole time, whereas the Chromecast loads the stream to the device itself, allowing you to check Twitter, Facebook or whatever else you want to do.</p>
<p>If you use any of the apps listed on the Chromecast site on a regular basis, for £30 you really can't go wrong.</p>

<title>New York</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/new-york/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/new-york/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I visited my friend over Christmas who is currently working in New York. I had an amazing time and I thought I would recommend some places I visited for anyone who is planning on visiting in the future, as well as to keep a record of what I got up to.</p>
<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<p>We ate at quite a few restaurants and these three are the ones I would recommend to anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://roguenyc.com">Rogue</a> - Rogue is a sports bar but the food is absolutely fantastic. As long as you can put up with all the sports (I counted seven simultaneous games on one occasion) being shown on their 14+ televisions, it's well worth a visit.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rubytuesday.com/">Ruby Tuesday, Times Square</a> - Ruby Tuesday is exactly what you'd expect from an American restaurant; huge portions, lots of meat and amazing buffalo chicken.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Attractions</h3>
<p>Ignoring the obvious, well-known attractions such as Times Square and the Empire State Building, <a href="http://thehighline.org">the High Line</a> was a personal highlight. The High Line is <em>&quot;a public park built on an historic freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattan’s West Side&quot;</em> and definitely makes a nice change of pace from barging past people on the streets. We took a ride on the <a href="http://www.circlelinedowntown.com/">Circleline Downtown Cruise</a> which gives great views of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline as well as Ellis Island and Governor's Island. We also did a helicoptor tour which gave spectacular views, but it is a little on the pricy side (~£100 p/person for 15 minutes). And I turned into a little kid when I visited the <a href="http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/">Nintendo Store</a> at the Rockefeller Center.</p>
<h3>Photos</h3>
<p><a href="http://edpoole.me">Ed</a> was kind enough to lend me his Canon 650D to take photos which was an interesting experience. Apparently, a good camera <em>doesn't</em> make you a good photographer. I got used to it after a couple of days and managed to get a few nice photos which I have <a href="https://rmlewisuk.exposure.so/new-york-2013">posted on Exposure</a>.</p>

<title>Create a Table in Markdown with No Headers</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/create-a-blank-no-header-markdown-table/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/create-a-blank-no-header-markdown-table/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whilst creating a document which requires me to put some data (which isn't in the slightest way tabular data) into a table, I wanted to create the table with no headers. However the way markdown works mean it requires you to set a header for it to create a table in the first place. By using the HTML non-breaking space entity it can be done:</p>
<pre class="language-markdown"><code class="language-markdown"><span class="token table"><span class="token table-header-row"><span class="token table-header important"><span class="token entity named-entity" title="&nbsp;">&amp;nbsp;</span> </span><span class="token punctuation">|</span><span class="token table-header important"> <span class="token entity named-entity" title="&nbsp;">&amp;nbsp;</span></span><br /></span><span class="token table-line"><span class="token punctuation">------</span> <span class="token punctuation">|</span> <span class="token punctuation">-----</span><br /></span><span class="token table-data-rows"><span class="token table-data">Stuff  </span><span class="token punctuation">|</span><span class="token table-data"> More things</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Simple.</p>

<title>Parents: Take Some Fucking Responsibility</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/parents-take-some-responsibility/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/parents-take-some-responsibility/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/10346236/Twins-rack-up-1000-iPad-bill-buying-virtual-pets.html">Telegraph reported this morning</a> that two six-year-olds racked up a £1000 bill through in app purchases because they knew their parents iTunes password. And of course the parents are placing the blame entirely on the developers of apps that include in-app purchases.</p>
<h3>Parental controls</h3>
<p>iOS has built in parental controls that allow for restrictions on downloading apps and when a password is required (either every 15 minutes, or always) among other settings. The problem is, there is no mention of these controls in the initial setup process, presumably to keep setup as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Parents may not be aware these settings exist and therefore just assume they can't restrict access to purchases or other features of the operating system. For reference, restrictions are in settings:</p>
<p>settings&gt;general&gt;restrictions</p>
<h3>The Blame Game</h3>
<p>The parents of the twins claim they knew the password for the account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...his children knew the password after using the iPad for schoolwork and games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Using the iPad for schoolwork&quot;? In what way would that involve needing the password for the iTunes account? So because they couldn't be bothered to check what their children were purchasing, they just gave them the password. Perhaps give them the pin number to your credit card so they can go and do their own shopping? They're six years old.</p>
<p>This is not the first time this has happened. Back in March an eight-year-old <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breakingnews/offbeat/boy-racks-up-a-1000-ipad-bill-29128775.html">spent £980 on The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a>. The parents responded by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I appreciate children are their target audience but it is not right and there needs to be specific controls in place to stop this from happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specific controls? Perhaps like the ones in settings?</p>
<p>In both cases, Apple refunded the money to the parents as a gesture of good will. Jim Darymple nails it in this peice entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/05/its-not-apples-job-to-be-a-parent-to-your-kids/">It's not Apple's Job to be a parent to your kids</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simple fact is, as parents, it’s up to us to monitor what our kids do with technology or any toy. If you choose not to use the included controls because they are a hassle, then that’s your choice. You made that decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parents: take some fucking responsibility, stop blaming everyone else and use some common sense instead of letting your kids do whatever the hell they want.</p>

<title>Pub Hack #1</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/pub-hack-1/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/pub-hack-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The first <a href="http://pubhack.co.uk">Pub Hack</a> took place yesterday. Jo and Lillian did an excellent job of organising everything including food, t-shirts, trophies as well as all the other behind-the-scenes stuff that needed doing.</p>
<p>The theme was &quot;post-apocolypse&quot; so pretty much everyone, including our team, took that to mean zombies. We wasted the first hour on an idea that we found had already been done and then got to work on &quot;<a href="http://blownover.meteor.com">Has It Blown Over Yet?</a>&quot;. Blown Over takes inspiration from <a href="http://uksnowmap.com">UK Snow Map</a>, and Shaun of the Dead, and allows people to report a zombie attack on Twitter (using the hashtag #pompeyzombie) or on the website. And of course it will show you pubs close to your location to wait for this to all blow over.</p>
<p>We only had 10 hours to build it so the Twitter integration is a little bit buggy and the map pins just keep building up forever. But overall I'm really happy with what we built.</p>
<p>There were some excellent entries including &quot;Apocalhipster&quot; which used an iPhone accelarometer and web sockets to control a zombie-shooting hipster, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; which used the battery level API to allow people to set off alarms on the laptops of those plugged into power and a first-person game set in the <a href="http://brewhouseandkitchen.com/">Brewhouse &amp; Kitchen</a>, where Pub Hack took place. There was also a similiar entry to ours tracking disasters across the world on a map and a directory of &quot;forts&quot; (read: pubs) in which to stay safe from the apocolypse.</p>
<p>Our team won &quot;Most Likely to Commercially Suceed&quot; which was awesome, Apocalhipster won &quot;Best Design&quot; and the 3D game won overall. It was a really great day and I can't wait for the next one.</p>

<title>Thoughts on the iPhone 5S and 5C</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/thoughts-on-the-iphone-5s-and-5c/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/thoughts-on-the-iphone-5s-and-5c/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So Apple had their iPhone event. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">iPhone 5S</a>. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/">iPhone 5C</a>. Nothing particularly surprising but interesting nonetheless.</p>
<h2>iPhone 5S</h2>
<p>The same solid design of the iPhone 5 with an improved camera, A7 chip and fingerprint scanner system called Touch ID. Touch ID is the feature I'm most excited about. Not because I find inputting a pin code &quot;cumbersome&quot;, as Phil Schiller said, but because I don't have to enter my password for iTunes purchases. And <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/10/hands-on-with-the-iphone-5c-and-iphone-5s/">according to Jim Darymple</a>, it works well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went through the process of adding my fingerprint to the 5S and then unlocking the phone using the fingerprint. It’s pretty seamless to do, just following the onscreen instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 5S comes in three colours, including the now-infamous &quot;gold&quot;. From what I've seen of it, this isn't some flashy over-the-top monstrosity but a more subtle gold finish. I still won't be buying a gold one though.</p>
<p>The camera has a lot of improvements including video recording at 120fps, a new burst mode for capturing action shots and a dual LED flash to &quot;light your subject perfectly&quot;.</p>
<h2>iPhone 5C</h2>
<p>The 5C is more or less an iPhone 5, with a slightly bigger battery and plastic back. It comes in five colours and you can get a <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MF035/iphone-5c-case-blue">hideous case</a> for it, if you so choose.</p>
<p>The interesting part about this model is it's not &quot;cheap&quot; per se. Yes, it £80 cheaper than the 5S but that's still not what I would call cheap. But it's cheap enough that it'll likely be free on most contracts in the UK.</p>
<p>Taking a quick look around some carriers websites today, I can't seem to find a mention of the 5S, but the 5C is on all the home pages. It seems to me that this is the phone they're going to be trying to sell over the 5S for obvious reasons.</p>
<h2>iWork, iMovie and iPhoto</h2>
<p>From now on, when you buy a new iPhone or iPad, you're going to get the complete iOS iWork suite, as well as iMovie and iPhoto, for free. This is a great move by Apple and I wouldn't be surprised if the same deal was announced for iWork for Mac when Mavericks is released.</p>
<h2>Release dates</h2>
<p>Pre orders for the 5C and 5S <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk">open on Friday</a>. iOS7 will be released the the public on 18th September, two days before the new iPhones.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2013/">watch the announcement here</a>.</p>

<title>JustDelete.me: One Million Page Views</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/just-delete-me-one-million-page-views/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/just-delete-me-one-million-page-views/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I wrote <a href="https://rknight.me/24-hours-of-just-delete-me/">this post</a> about <a href="http://justdelete.me">justdelete.me</a> I assumed that would pretty much be the best I could hope for in terms of traffic. 3000 visitors in 24 hours was an amazing response to get.The last few days? We’ve been doing that in half an hour.</p>
<h2>News coverage</h2>
<p>The coverage in the news has been insane. We were picked up by <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/58698882020/robb-lewis-just-delete-me">Minimal Mac</a> on Monday and the traffic stayed pretty steady for the next couple of days. Then we were <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013-08-just-delete-me/">featured in WIRED</a> which skyrocketed traffic. From there, many of the other tech blogs picked up the story and we ended up at number one on Hacker News, trending on GitHub, number one on <a href="https://pinboard.in/popular/">Pinboard popular</a> and Christina Warren was interviewed about the site on <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/on-air/varney-co/index.html">Varney and Co on Fox Business</a>. Other sites that picked it up include <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013-08-23/justdelete-me-wants-to-help-you-pull-the-plug-on-all-those-pesky-online-accounts/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2013-08-24/justdelete-me/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-main-link">Mashable</a> and <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013-08-23/painlessly-erase-your-internet-life-with-justdelete-me/">Gigaom</a>. I was also interviewed for <a href="http://thetechtailor.com/justdeleteme">The Tech Tailor podcast</a>. All of the links I have found about the site are <a href="https://pinboard.in/search/u:rmlewisuk?query=justdeleteme">on Pinboard</a> tagged as justdeleteme.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>I’ve got a little confession to make. I’ve never had more than 10 visitors on my site at the same time (except that one time Panic linked to me and the site died immediately). My hosting was costing me $1.50 a month. The server held up until around Thursday night when CPU usage was at 100%. <a href="http://edpoole.me">Ed</a>, <a href="http://mikerogers.io">Mike</a> and myself all jumped on a Skype call to work out what to do. Stupidly, I hadn’t even made the site static (thinking that hardly anyone would be interested) so we immediately converted it to static. We then cloned the site to <a href="http://mdtm.pl/17Wu4ia">MediaTemple</a>, changed the name servers and waited. It took about 2 days for it to fully transfer over but the majority of traffic was going to MT which has held up really well. Since we moved the site, we’ve used over 80gb of bandwidth even though the site is only around 200kb.</p>
<h2>Contributors and Future plans</h2>
<p>We’re going to continue adding services from pull requests (We’ve done 130 from 61 different contributors so far) and I will open email submission again soon. We now have over 180 services listed (the current count is shown in the console on page load if you’re interested) which I’m sure will expand in the coming weeks. In terms of making some money to cover hosting and analytics costs we’re going to see how the traffic is in a week or two when the frenzy has died down and make a decision then.</p>
<p><a href="http://tosdr.org">Terms of Service; Didn’t Read</a> are looking at integrating our data with theirs to keep as much information up to date as possible. The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/justdeleteme/hfpofkfbabpbbmchmiekfnlcgaedbgcf">JustDelete.me Chrome Extension</a> is receiving some great feedback and Mike is currently considering creating versions for Firefox and Safari.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>We have been tracking visitor numbers with <a href="https://www.gosquared.com/r/NjE0MzM4">GoSquared</a>. GoSquared are a real-time analytics company and they have been awesome in terms of supporting us and helping with upgrades. I can’t recommended, and thank, them enough. The top sources of traffic for the last 10 days are:</p>
<ul>

<title>24 Hours of Just Delete Me</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/24-hours-of-just-delete-me/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/24-hours-of-just-delete-me/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“<em>I’m sure I’ll get a couple of hundred visitors</em>”. That’s what I was thinking yesterday when I launched <a href="http://justdelete.me">justdelete.me</a>. I wasn’t completely wrong.</p>
<p>The response to justdelete.me has been incredible. In just 24 hours it was linked to by <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/58698882020/robb-lewis-just-delete-me">Minimal Mac</a> (swoon!), tweeted and retweeted by hundreds of people and had over 3000 visitors.</p>
<p>Since launch five additional services have been added: Reddit, Lovefilm, MySpace, Amazon and Klout. To add Klout, I had to sign up for it to immediately delete my account. I saw things. Crazy, strange things. How’s that for dedication?</p>
<p>Other stats of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitors from over 70 different countries</li>
<li>Around 30% of people were using Chrome</li>
<li>Someone from <a href="http://d.pr/i/I8JN">Apple visited</a></li>
<li>The top three operating systems were OS X 10.8, iOS 6.1 and Windows 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Also Ed, who designed the site, isn’t getting anywhere near enough credit for the project so <a href="http://edpoole.me/portfolio">go visit his portfolio</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After seeing a few tweets about how difficult it can be to delete your Skype account and then hearing that Netflix flat-out <em>won’t</em> delete your details I decided to build <a href="http://justdelete.me">JustDelete.me</a>.</p>
<p>JustDelete.Me is a directory of urls to delete your account from web services. (Yes, I am aware how terrible that description is. If you’ve got a better one, <a href="https://rknight.me/contact">let me know</a>). Services are marked either easy, medium or hard depending on how difficult it is to delete that account. Those marked as hard have additional information on how to completely remove your account, such as Skype which requires you to contact customer services to do so.</p>
<p>A lot of inspiration for the site came from Steve Streza’s <a href="http://devcenter.me">DevCenter.me</a> and the search functionality is modified from the repository. I thought about just forking the repo and modifying it but the sites are different enough to warrant the time to build it myself. Also, where would have been the fun in that? <a href="http://edpoole.me">Ed Poole</a> did a great on job on taking the initial concept and making it look a hell of a lot nicer than what I &quot;designed&quot;.</p>
<p>At present there are 16 services listed. If you want to add a new service, <a href="https://rknight.me/contact">drop me an email</a> and let me know. Alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/rmlewisuk/justdelete.me">fork the repo</a> on GitHub, add the site to the json file and submit a pull request.</p>

<title>Lego Back to The Future Set Review</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/lego-back-to-the-future-set-review/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/lego-back-to-the-future-set-review/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/lego-back-to-the-future-set-review.png" /></p>
<p>I <em>love</em> Back to The Future. I even have a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/HZnNqHMrQx/">DeLorean tattoo</a>. Back in December of last year, <a href="http://blog.lego.cuusoo.com/2012-12-20/results-of-the-summer-lego-review/">Lego announced that </a> that they were going to be making a Back to The Future themed set. On Saturday my Back to The Future Lego set arrived and I opened it like a kid on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>The set has 401 pieces, plus the usual random selection of spares, and a <em>huge</em> instruction manual. A majority of the manual is to construct the DeLorean from the first film with the last few pages showing the modifications needed to make the other two versions. You get both the “OUTATIME” licence plate as well as the barcode one from the future.</p>
<p>The flux capacitor custom brick is great and the time circuit states the destination time, rather than 1955, as 1958 which is the year the first Lego brick was introduced. The gull-wing doors are particularly fun to use, despite not having actual windows in them. They can be a little fragile and tend to fall off if I try and move the set whilst holding them.</p>
<p>The Marty and Doc minifigures have double-sided faces (happy and shocked) and Doc has a double sided body; one side is his lab coat and one is a radiation suit. The figures are slightly too big to fit comfortably into the car, making it somewhat frustrating to close the doors. Although the finished product doesn’t look <em>exactly</em> like the films, it’s pretty close considering it’s made of Lego and if you’re a fan of Back to The Future, you’re going to want this set. I got mine from <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/The-DeLorean-time-machine-21103">the Lego online store</a> but it’s available pretty much anywhere Lego sets are sold.</p>

<title>Instapaper Beta</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/instapaper-beta/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/instapaper-beta/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Instapaper, having been <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013-04-25/instapaper-next-generation">sold to Betaworks</a> in April, has a <a href="http://beta.instapaper.com">shiny new beta</a> for the web interface which is long overdue. Not that the site wasn’t usable, but it was starting to feel very dated when compared to the likes of <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>. Despite this I had stuck with Instapaper as it had the one thing Pocket still doesn’t have: a way for me to pay them for the service, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>The new interface is a complete overhaul of the old site and looks great. There are a number of things that could do with improvement (too much whitespace, not great on smaller screens) but it’s still in beta so I’m sure things will get better before the public release.</p>
<p>It’s nice, for once, to see something be sold and not just left to fade into internet history. Although it was fairly certain this wouldn’t happen based on what Marco Arment said in this announcement of the sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve structured the deal with Instapaper’s health and longevity as the top priority, with incentives to keep it going well into the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the web beta, <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/57817543037">Betaworks said in a blog post</a> that there will be “<em>..new versions of the Instapaper iOS and Android apps</em>”. This is an exciting time for Instapaper users and the future looks great for the service.</p>

<title>Automatically Rename TV Shows with Hazel and TVNamer</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/automatically-rename-tv-shows-with-hazel-and-tvnamer/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/automatically-rename-tv-shows-with-hazel-and-tvnamer/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I download a lot of TV shows (all legal of course) and have been renaming the files using <a href="https://github.com/tvrenamer/tvrenamer">TVRenamer</a>. After using TVRenamer manually for months I got fed up with having to do it, or the much more likely scenario happened where I would just leave them to build up in my downloads folder. I recently started using <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> to automatically rename and organise my photos. This works well because Hazel simply changes the filename to the date they were taken. TV shows are a little more complex than that as they have season and episode numbers as well as titles. Enter <a href="https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer">TVNamer</a>.</p>
<p>TVNamer is a command line utility that takes a TV episode with an ugly filename (show.name.3x20.720[HD].avi) and changes it to something much more readable (ShowName S03E20 - Episode Title.avi). To install TVNamer follow the simple instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/blob/master/readme.md">readme</a>, it only takes a couple of minutes. Once it’s installed to can use it by simple typing:</p>
<p>tvnamer </p>
<p>TVNamer will then parse the file, look for episode information and, if it finds more than one result, will prompt you to choose the correct one and confirm the rename. When I tested this the correct result was always the first one which makes using Hazel to automate the process much easier.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Hazel, it’s a preference pane for Mac that monitors folders and matches files based on rules much like iTunes smart playlists. You can then set actions to perform when your rules are matched such as move files, rename them or run shell scripts.</p>
<p>To setup automatic renaming, open Hazel, select the folder where your TV shows download to, then add a new rule. Obviously rules will entirely depend on the type of files you choose to download but personally I set Hazel to find any files that have the extension <em>mkv</em>, <em>avi</em> or <em>mp4</em>. Then choose to run a shell script on the matched files and choose <em>“embedded script”</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Hazel Screenshot" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/automatically-rename-tv-shows-with-hazel-and-tvnamer-sshot.png" /></p>
<p>Select edit script and paste in the following:</p>
<p>/usr/local/bin/tvnamer --batch &quot;$1&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>–batch</em> option tells TVNamer to automatically choose the first result and rename it and the <em>$1</em> refers to the matched file Hazel found. To test your rule is working select the cog dropdown in the main Hazel screen and select <em>&quot;Run rules now&quot;</em>. Any files that match your Hazel rule should be renamed.</p>
<p>Initially I found that Hazel can sometimes have issues with running TVNamer if you’re matching files within subdirectories of your downloads folder. To remedy this I have Hazel move matched files to another folder and rename them from there. Refer to <a href="http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/app-training/9-hazel-rules-to-increase-your-productivity/">this Tuts+ guide</a> to find out how to use Hazel to move files automatically.</p>

<p>Spotted this tip on Twitter (I can't remember/find who tweeted it, sorry!) and it blew my mind. When resizing a window in OS X, hold down alt. The window will stay centered on the screen. Amazing.</p>

<title>Google Reader and Alternatives</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/google-reader-and-alternatives/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google have announced that they're shutting down Google Reader come July 1st:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We launched Google Reader in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with Google Takeout over the course of the next four months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They call it usage decline but it's more likely that most users are simply using it as a sync engine to access their feeds through apps like <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. Whatever the reasons, this leaves many of us at a dead end in terms of reading RSS. You can of course export your data and Dave Caolo has <a href="http://52tiger.net/daily-tip-export-your-feeds-from-google-reader/">outlined the process on 52Tiger</a>. Other have mentioned using services like <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> or <a href="https://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a> but I've always found these apps to be a little bloated and they don't really fit with how I like to consume news. The only viable alternative as of right now is <a href="http://www.feedafever.com/">Fever</a>. Fever is a self-hosted aggregator and is supported on iOS by the aforementioned Reeder as well as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8">Sunstroke</a>. Of course, being self-hosted means you're going to have to have somewhere to install it and at least some knowledge of server-side tech. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/how-anyone-can-install-fever-in-ten-minutes/">MacStories</a> have got a great tutorial to get you started. There is hope, however, in the form of <a href="http://feedwrangler.net/">Feed Wrangler</a> a project by <a href="https://alpha.app.net/davidsmith">David Smith</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project is already well along in development, with a working web interface and native apps. I was expecting to launch early this summer but Google has announced that they are closing down Reader July 1. That accelerates my plans and I am now working to get ready for public consumption as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between Fever, Feed Wrangler as well as projects that haven't been announced yet June might not be so bad for RSS after all.</p>

<title>70Decibels and 5by5</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/70decibels-and-5by5/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/70decibels-and-5by5/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://www.70decibels.com/blog/2013/3/13/were-moving-to-5by5.html">70Decibels is merging with 5by5</a> which is great news for everyone involved, including listeners. Myke has worked incredibly hard to get 70Decibels to where it is today, starting with The Bro Show and expanding to the packed list of shows now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>70Decibels is nearly 18 months old. It's amazing what has happened in that time and we all know that we owe it all to you, the listeners. Without you tuning in every week, getting involved, asking questions, promoting us and letting us know when we fall short, we wouldn't be here. I just want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done to get us to this point. All of us at the network cannot wait to share what comes next. Thank you all so much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not only a fan of 70Decibels and 5by5 but also, I'm glad to say, Myke's friend. I couldn't be happier for him and this merger is one step closer to him going full time as a podcaster extraordinaire. Myke and Dan announced and talked at length about the merger, as well as podcasting in general on <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/3/13/033-a-big-announcement-with-dan-benjamin.html">CMD+Space 033</a>.</p>

<title>DIY Game Controller Rack</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/diy-game-controller-rack/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/diy-game-controller-rack/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two Playstation 2, two GameCube, four N64, two Xbox, four Wii, two Guitar Hero. You get the idea, I have lots of controllers. So does <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/03-02-playing-nintendo-games-on-a-mac/">Matt Gemmell</a>. And I'm sure, so do a lot of other people. My solution for organising them is a fairly simple one, but I haven't seen it documented elsewhere on the web. So here it is.</p>
<p>I had an old DVD rack not being used for anything so I figured using that would be a good start (and avoid any cost to me). I purchased some blank DVD cases and popped them in every forth slot. This gave me enough spaces to house all of my controllers as well as a couple of spaces for Wii Nunchucks. I also left a larger space at the bottom for those damn Wii wheels and a mug which holds all of my controller extension cables, extra memory cards for the PS2 and GameCube.</p>
<p><img alt="Whole game controller rack" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/diy-game-controller-rack-whole.png" /> For the Guitar Hero controllers, I put some screws in each side of the rack (measuring the width before, of course) and wrapped them in Cellotape although electrical tape, which I didn't have, would have been better. The Guitars slot nicely into these and hang out the way. I also stuck one screw in the front of the rack for the Wii Zapper.</p>
<p><img alt="guiter hero controller holder" src="http://rmlewisuk.s3.amazonaws.com/diy-game-controller-rack-guitar.png" /></p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>

<title>The Difference Between Fact and Trivia</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/the-difference-between-fact-and-trivia/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/the-difference-between-fact-and-trivia/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This morning I took a practice exam for one of the web units I’m studying. Most of the questions were fairly easy but one of them in particular annoyed me. The question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“PageRank is so named because it was created by Larry Page, not because it ranks pages”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I incorrectly marked this as <em>false</em>. When I asked how much trivia we would be asked in the exam, my lecturer told me (quite agressively) that the question is not trivia but a fact that is useful to know. I argued the counterpoint, saying a fact is something useful to developing my understanding of a specific topic or technology, in this case, PageRank. She disagreed.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from an archived version of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090424093934/http://www.google.com/press/funfacts.html">Google Fun Facts Page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basis of Google’s search technology is called PageRank™, and assigns an “importance” value to each page on the web and gives it a rank to determine how useful it is. However, that’s not why it’s called PageRank. It’s actually named after Google co-founder Larry Page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part of that statement is the fact. The last sentence is trivia. It holds no bearing on my understanding of PageRank. Should we really be tested on trivial facts about Google, or any other company for that matter? In my opinion, no.</p>
<p>Rant over.</p>

<title>What to Do When Your iTunes Account Gets Hacked</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/what-to-do-when-your-itunes-account-gets-hacked/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/what-to-do-when-your-itunes-account-gets-hacked/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Early Saturday morning, 2a.m. to be exact, I recieved an email from Apple confirming my lastest purchase. Nothing unusual, I buy apps all the time. Didn’t bother checking it, just marked it as read and archived it. Then I started thinking about what I had bought that day from the iTunes store. I couldn’t think of anything, so I checked the email: £149.99 for an in-app purchase of NBA Season Pass. “Shit” was my first reaction. My account had been comprimised.</p>
<p>As someone with a keen interested in technology and specifically Apple, I’ve read about this stuff countless times and yet I had no idea what to do. So I had to wing it. First thing was fairly obvious: change my password. If your account gets comprimised, this is the first thing you need to do. To do this go to <a href="http://iforgot.apple.com">http://iforgot.apple.com</a> and reset your password.</p>
<p>Once I had done that, I had no idea how to go about getting Apple to stop/refund the charge. I Googled around and came across <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/contact/">this contact page</a> on Apple’s site. I went through the various options and eventually got to a point where I could request a support call. No sooner had I selected for Apple to call me, than my phone rang.</p>
<p>Trying to sound reasonably calm, I explained to the lady on the phone that the purchase was not me and I needed a refund. She very clearly told me what she was doing at all times, confirmed with me that I had changed my password and told me I would get a refund within 24 hours.</p>
<p>At this point (around 3am) I went to sleep. When I woke up I had an email from both Apple, and Click and Buy, confirming that the refund had been sucessfully processed. And breath. To clarify, for anyone who is reading this because their account has been comprimised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change you password immediately <a href="http://iforgot.apple.com">http://iforgot.apple.com</a></li>
<li>Request a support call from <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/contact/">http://www.apple.com/support/contact/</a></li>
<li>Relax</li>
</ol>
<p>The most annoying part about the whole thing? Because I’m in the UK, I couldn’t have purchased the season pass even if I wanted to, as it’s US only. It was a scary moment that I hope not to have to repeat. However, Apple’s fast response time and the helpfulness of the representative who I spoke to on the phone are exactly the reason why I buy into Apple’s ecosystem.</p>

<title>The State of Passbook in the UK</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/the-state-of-passbook-in-the-uk/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/the-state-of-passbook-in-the-uk/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As you probably know, Passbook support is a little bit sparse in the UK at the moment.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Eventbrite app got <a href="http://blog.eventbrite.com/add-eventbrite-tickets-to-passbook-on-ios-6/">updated to support Passbook</a> which is great news for anyone who uses the service. But what about the somewhat more day-to-day apps? I searched around, or asked directly, to get some answers.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/UKTesco/status/253465105130479616">Tesco</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”We don’t have any information as yet”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nectar/status/253477171304226816">Nectar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Hi James, passbook on ios6 does look exciting and we’re looking into it’s opportunities, so watch this space :) ^SD”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AskAmex/status/252113756950249472">American Express </a> (which already has Passbook support in the US):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Hi there Andy! Regrets, at this time we do not have any information in regards to AMEX Pass in the UK. We will update you if avail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CostaCoffee/status/251300909336903680">Costa Coffee</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”not as yet :-( this is something we are reviewing - Thanks Hannah”</p>
<p>”this is not something that has been confirmed unfortunately, hopefully it may be something that is implemented in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/British_Airways/status/251324123026964480">British Airways</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”…That’s something our team are currently looking into. Thanks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promising, but when asked about an ETA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Not yet but we are certainly aware of the interest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/249202870891728896">Starbucks (US account)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Updated to iOS 6? Our Passbook update is coming at the end of this month! 00111010 00101001”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was on the 21st of September. Although judging by some of their tweets, it seems it might be stuck in review. I have been unable to find any information as to whether this update will support the UK as well. From the <a href="https://twitter.com/StarbucksUK/status/250958138176569344">Starbucks UK account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Not too much to ask! We’re working on it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat inconclusive.</p>
<p>There is some hope, however. Amsys are <a href="http://www.amsys.co.uk/2012/blog/passbook-comes-to-amsys-apple-training/">sending Passbook passes</a> when you book a training course with them and I did find an online <a href="http://www.odeon.co.uk/film30/">Passbook coupon from Odeon</a>, so there are a couple of companies who “get it”. Hopefully, more companies will begin to understand how important this could be to thier business, we’ll start to see the Passbook page populated with more than just airlines and that one hotel company. If there’s any apps, services or other Passbook related paraphernalia I may have missed, drop me a message <a href="http://twitter.com/rmlewisuk">on Twitter</a> or <a href="http://alpha.app.net/rmlewisuk">App.net</a>.</p>

<title>Delivery Companies: The Antithesis of Convenience</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/delivery-companies-the-antithesis-of-convenience/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/delivery-companies-the-antithesis-of-convenience/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I wrote about delivery companies a couple of weeks ago and I have been thinking about the issues surrounding this and how it could be fixed (in an ideal world).</p>
<p><strong>Operating hours</strong></p>
<p>The thing that annoys me the most is the operating hours of delivery companies. As an example, my local Domino’s is open from midday until midnight every day. The opening hours are set based on when people would most likely want pizza. McDonald’s opens at 7am for people who want breakfast. Newsagents open early to be able to sell newspapers while they’re still relevant. And yet, delivery companies continue to maintain a schedule that is the antithesis of convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Notification and tracking</strong></p>
<p>Most delivery companies offer some kind of order tracking, but rarely is this as useful in real life as it is in theory. Telling me every time someone scans my parcel at some middle-of-nowhere sorting office is not helpful. Here’s what I actually want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>When my parcel is dispatched</li>
<li>When my parcel is on the delivery van</li>
<li>When my parcel is an hour away, or at least an estimated delivery slot</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. Whether it’s by phone, email, text or Twitter, just let me know when my parcel is going be arriving, within a reasonable time slot.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200742950">Amazon Locker</a> goes some way to solving at least some of the issues. But at the moment, it can only be used for specific items that Amazon sell. It’s a start, but we’re a long way off of a seamless online buying experience. As a side note, I used Amazon Locker for the first time this week, and was very impressed with the entire process.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>As a business, your operating hours should match the hours that are convenient to your customers. You should want to make the experience as seamless and easy as possible for your customers. The problem is, we are not the customers. Much like Facebook’s customers are their advertisers and not the users, delivery companies are accountable only to thier customers: the businesses that are sending us our latest toys that we’ve ordered online. The problem is the delivery companies don’t care how the experience is for us, how difficult is it to take a day off work just to sign for a parcel or how annoying it is to go to the “local” sorting office between similarly inconvenient hours. We don’t pay them, we are not thier customers. And that’s the problem.</p>

<title>Get Custom Screensavers on the Kindle 4 on OS X</title>
<link>https://rknight.me/get-custom-screensavers-on-the-kindle-4-mac-osx/</link>
<guid>https://rknight.me/get-custom-screensavers-on-the-kindle-4-mac-osx/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This guide is for getting custom screensavers onto the new Kindle (Non-Touch) using Mac OSX.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is plug your Kindle into your Mac via USB. Then create a file with the name <code>ENABLE_DIAGS</code> and make sure it has <em>no extension</em> (e.g. .txt, .jpg). Copy this file to the root of your Kindle and then eject. Now go into settings and restart your Kindle and it should enter diagnostics mode.</p>
<p>Once your in the diagnostics mode, go to <code>Misc individual diagnostics &gt; Utilities &gt; Enable USBnet</code> and press the right arrow to confirm. You are now ready to create the folder you'll need to add custom screensavers.  Connect your Kindle to your Mac and open up network preferences.</p>
<p>On the left hand side you should see <code>RNDIS/…Gadget</code> in the connections list. Select this and then change <code>Configure Ipv4</code> to &quot;manually&quot;. Change the IP address to <code>192.168.15.1</code>. Now open up the Terminal (Applications &gt; Terminal). From the terminal you will need to enter each of these commands one by one either by typing them out, or copying and pasting each one. I would suggest using <a href="http://pastebin.com/17czdUS7">this pastebin dump</a> to copy from to avoid any weird issues. The root password is <code>mario</code>, enter this when prompted (after the first command).</p>
<p>The commands you need to enter are as follows:</p>
<p><code>ssh root@192.168.15.1</code></p>
<p><code>enter password if/when prompted</code></p>
<p><code>mntroot rw mkdir /mnt/us/screensaver mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/base-mmc mv /mnt/base-mmc/opt/amazon/screen_saver/600x800 /mnt/base-mmc/opt/amazon/screen_saver/600x800.old ln -sfn /mnt/us/screensaver /mnt/base-mmc/opt/amazon/screen_saver/600x800</code></p>
<p>Now you can disconnect your Kindle and exit the diagnostics mode. To do this, simply press the right arrow to exit each menu until you see <code>Exit, Reboot or Disable Diags</code>. Select this and then choose <code>Disable diags</code> and confirm with the left arrow and your Kindle should reboot. Once your Kindle has rebooted, connect it back up to your Mac and open it in Finder. There should be a new folder called &quot;Screensavers&quot;. Simply put your custom screensavers in that folder and restart your Kindle. And voila, custom screensavers!</p>
<p>If you need screensavers, I found most of the ones I'm using from <a href="http://kindlewallpapers.tumblr.com/">here</a>. If you want to create your own, screensavers must be in .jpg or .png format and have dimensions of 600 x 800. Have fun!</p>
